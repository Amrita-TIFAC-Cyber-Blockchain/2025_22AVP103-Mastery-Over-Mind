I’m deeply grateful to Pranav for being my academic anchor. From late-night study sessions to last-minute doubt clearing, you’ve always been there with 
clarity and patience. Your ability to explain tough concepts in simple terms has helped me more than any textbook. You’ve shown me that learning is better when 
shared, and I’ll always cherish the way we pushed each other to do better.

I am sincerely grateful to my Warden for being a pillar of support and discipline throughout my hostel life at Amrita. Your presence has brought a sense of 
safety, structure, and care to our daily routines. Whether it was handling emergencies, resolving conflicts, or simply checking in on our well-being, you’ve always 
been approachable and fair.
Living away from home isn’t easy, but your guidance made the hostel feel like a second home. I especially appreciate your patience during exam times and your 
efforts to maintain a peaceful environment for all of us. Thank you for your dedication and for being a steady force in our college journey.
