Topic:writing about the three people to whom I am grateful for meeting them in my btech life until now.


             The three people I am gratefultfor meeting them in the college are s charan(my friend), abhijeet (my senior) and srinivasan sir (my class maths lecture).

scenario 1. my friend-s charan 
                 I am grateful to meet charan during my btech education.firstly i meet him in the college only and thta to on the orentation day only.on that day i still rememberedthat he was been full of positive vibes and with a joyful nature but i am was full of stress and i wished to talk to someone that who can change my mood. so by luckily i found him and i was in a positive mood within few minutes only and i am really grateful to the god also for giving me a great friend like him and from that when i am in any worry also he used to help me in many things and used  to be my booster for new thoughts. He was the one person who always keep on helping me in my problems and struggles that I faced in my begining time that are related to my education or my btech life also.He has been my roommate and one of my closest companions in college.At first, I didn’t realize he would become such an important part of my daily routine. He was cheerful and always smiling, which made everyone around him feel comfortable. What I appreciate most about him is how he can bring laughter even during tough times. When I was struggling to fit in, his presence made everything feel lighter.There was one day I will never forget. It was right after our internal exams. I had worked hard for a subject I found difficult, yet I received a disappointing score. I remember sitting quietly in the canteen, trying to hide my frustration. Mahilesh came over, noticed my expression, and instead of saying anything serious, he joked about how the exam paper seemed like it was written in another language. He made up funny stories about how even the teacher might have been confused while creating the paper. It was silly, yet I couldn’t help but laugh. In that moment, my sadness disappeared. That’s what Mahilesh does. He doesn’t lecture or give advice. He simply lightens the mood. His friendly and joyful nature makes every day more cheerful and positive. Whenever I fell stress or not motiveted, he was always there to get my spirits. His constant encouragement and positive attitude helped me regain confidence and stay focused on my goals. I have learned from him the importance of staying happy and spreading positivity even in difficult situations. I will always remember his inspiring words that keep motivating me to move forward in life.Spending time with him i realised that it is really important to take care of both our health and mind equally. I have been able to realise that sitting with a book 24/7 alone won't help you achive great heights , a good fitness is nessasary to maintain our energy and gain respect throught our success journey.he reminded me that I am not alone and that together we can face any problem. This kindnfrom him means a lot to me, especially in a place where I sometimes miss my family.Emotional Support and real Friendship Living with me has taught me the value of emotional support. College was very new phase of my life, and I have faced my share of tough days. Whether it is stress from exams, homesick, or the challenge of  everything, there have been times when I felt like I couldnot handle it without his help.


scenario 2. my senior-abhijeet              
                abhijeet is my senior in my intermediate level and in my btech life also. who made me get aware of the situations that I can face in my educational level I mean in the exams that I want to face in the 2nd year of intermediate.and now also from the begining onwards when i have joined the amrita college for my btech life he used to give me much more support then anyone else.if i want to say one thing that i am grateful in this college is about his presence during the college hackathon became one of the most meaningful experiences of my journey. When our team decided to participate, I was both excited and nervous. We had enthusiasm, but not much direction. That’s when abhijeet anna stepped in — not as a supervisor, but as a mentor and motivator.He had a calm and encouraging way of explaining things. Whenever we were stuck or uncertain, he would patiently listen, help us refocus, and guide us toward simple yet effective solutions. I remember how he constantly reminded us that teamwork mattered more than competition. His belief in our abilities pushed me to overcome my fear of failure.What made his guidance special was the way he taught through experience. Instead of giving ready-made answers, he helped us discover them ourselves. Every interaction with him taught me something new — not only about coding or logic, but about how to stay composed under pressure and how to keep moving forward when things don’t go as planned.he is only the guy who tells me about every phase of the life that i am going to face in my future and gives me much more information about the skills and the amount of education that is required for that what i want to become and he keeps me in pushing front in every situation and makes me to face every part of my life with full guts and full courage . And I admire his patience and willingness to help others without expecting anything in return. His guidance has inspired me to help others in the same way. Having a familiar face from school has made my college life more comfortable and enjoyable. abhijeet anna is a very support give  and knowledge giving person who is always ready to help me whenever I face difficulties. He often teaches me new things and shares useful information that helps me improve both academiclly and personal. I truly appreciate his friendship, sincere, and willing self ness to see others succeed. His presence reminds me of the value of long live friendships build on trust and understanding.

Apart from teaching academic subjects, he also emphasized the importance of communication skills, discipline, and self-confidence. His words of wisdom and practical lessons have had a lasting impact on my outlook toward education and personal growth.He believes in teaching us how to solve problems by understanding the root causes. This has helped me become more independent and responsible in my studies and life.Sir also guides us on how to manage our time well, balance studies and personal life, and work toward our goals steadily. I remember many times when I felt stressed about exams or projects, and sir’s words of encouragement helped me calm down and focus on my work. His advice about staying positive and working hard has left a strong impact on me.Apart from academic advice, dama sir cares about our overall development. He organizes group activities, meetings, and events to bring us closer as classmates. Through these activities, we learn teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. Sir always encourages us to respect each other’s opinions, work together, and support our classmates, creating a friendly and positive environment in our class.He is very approachable and always available when we need him. I appreciate how sir never makes us feel rushed or ignored, no matter how busy he is. Whenever we visit him with questions or concerns, he gives us his full attention and treats our problems seriously. This shows how much he cares about our success and well-being.Dama sir is also very disciplined and professional. He is always punctual, organized, and well-prepared for meetings and discussions.
