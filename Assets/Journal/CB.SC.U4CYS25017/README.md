# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
date-28/09/2025
SCENARIO 1
I honestly feel really grateful for my best friend Revanth. He’s my study partner, and somehow he never loses patience with me, no matter how messy or confusing the topic gets. Even if I ask the same doubt two or three times, he doesn’t get irritated. He just explains it again in his own simple way, and half the time I realise I was overthinking for no reason. He makes even tough stuff feel a bit lighter.

And when I get stuck or feel like I’m not improving, he’s the first one to motivate me. He keeps telling me that progress is more important than perfection, and weirdly that line stays in my head a lot. Because of him, I don’t feel alone while studying. Having someone like Revanth who supports me and pushes me gently—that really means a lot to me

SCENARIO 2
I was honestly really thankful to my friend Ashwin Sai that day. Being a hosteller, I seriously had no idea where Amazon packages even get dropped in our college. I was just roaming around confused and didn’t know what to do. Instead of telling me “go ask someone” or “manage it yourself,” he just said he’ll order the product to his home. He didn’t even think for a second — he just said okay and did it.


It might sound like a simple thing, but for me it actually made everything so much easier. That small help showed me what real friendship feels like… helping without questions, without any attitude, and making sure the other person doesn’t struggle. That day, Ashwin honestly showed how thoughtful he actually is.

SCENARIO 3
I honestly felt really thankful to Rama Guru Sir that day. On 28th October 2025, he suddenly came and actually sat with us, asking what problems we were facing in PSAT and even with mam’s teaching. We didn’t expect him to take that much interest, but he just listened to everything calmly. We told him all the small issues we had, and he didn’t judge us or make us feel like we were complaining too much. Whatever important points we mentioned, he directly went and spoke to mam about it without making the situation awkward for us.
And after that, we could actually see the change. Mam started explaining things in a clearer way, and she even told us she’ll give proper notes. For me, that whole moment felt nice because you don’t always see a teacher genuinely taking your problems seriously and trying to fix them. Sir’s support and the way he looks out for us honestly made me feel a bit more motivated to put effort into the subject.
