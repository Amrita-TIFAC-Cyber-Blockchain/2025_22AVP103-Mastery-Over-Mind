</p>The three incidents that happened which i really grateful am for are..

Near start of august..
For Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi Devi)
I am extremely grateful for Amma's love and guidance. Even though I may not see her everyday, her compassion and wisdom constantly tells me to stay grounded, kind and have selfless love. Amma's guidance remainds me that education isn't just about gaining knowledge it's about growing in empathy and inner peace..

Near mid august..
The teacher who kindof inspired me a lot was our Principles of Engineering proffessor Amit Agarwal. What made me to be inspired by him was his way of teaching. His way of teaching was really carefree which forced us to search for the syllabus ourselves which proved really grateful as it made us understand the concepts ourselves. I think in my opinion that it is the best way to learn things because that way the things we learn would be way more interesting..

At the starting of august..
Finally..
Of course just like everybody else the people who i found maybe fortunately but luckily .
Who dearly are Ridhanya,Tejashree,Kavya,Shivani,Anushree. They were really supportive and gave me confidence when i needed it. I really am grateful for them because without them I clearly have no idea I would have survived the first week of college so nice..
Also I really feel appreciated for this great oppurtunity i got to share what I found inspiring and grateful..really thanking you sir..
