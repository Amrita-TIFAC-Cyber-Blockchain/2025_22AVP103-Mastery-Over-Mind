# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind

Scenario 1
When Mahiesh Helped Me Through the Chaos
Date: September 14th, 2025

September 14th turned into one of those weeks where everything piles up at once. Four different assignments, a presentation I was dreading, and a group project all hit at the same time. Looking back, I realize how lucky I am to have Mahiesh as my friend, because without him that day, I honestly don't know if I would've made it through.

Let me paint the picture. In Problem-Solving and Algorithmic Thinking, we had to write down everything ma'am taught us throughout the entire week on an A4 heet. Then Linear Algebra Assignment ten questions on Linear transformation and basis. I stared at those problems feeling like I was reading a different language. Cyber Security Essentials required us to use Burp Suite to intercept credentials from five popular websites, take screenshots, and submit everything. Each website took 30-40 minutes to properly capture.

On top of this, we had our P-SAT presentation on "Artificial Intelligence Evolution from 1950 to 1970." I got the first three pages. Here's the thing—I'm not a natural public speaker. I get nervous, my hands shake, my voice cracks. The thought of presenting was eating me up inside. And our group project about CATL's new battery technology that would reshape the industry in 2025 required constant coordination with the team.

My sleep schedule was destroyed. I went to bed at 12 AM every night, woke up at 6 AM for my 7 AM bus. Those six hours weren't enough. My eating habits tanked too. Mom would pack lunch, but I'd barely touch it—too stressed to feel hungry or too busy finishing assignments during break.

So there I was on September 14th, sitting in the AB2 library at 12 PM. The entrance area where boys sit was packed and noisy as usual. I had my laptop open, just staring at the screen. Not typing, not reading, just staring. My brain felt like mush.

I called Mahiesh. He showed up within minutes. When he saw me, he pulled out a chair, sat down, and said, "You look stressed."

Those three words, man. Sometimes that's all you need. Not someone trying to fix everything, just someone acknowledging that yes, you're going through it.

I started venting. Everything poured out—the assignments, the presentation anxiety, the group project issues, the lack of sleep, the pressure. I talked non-stop for ten minutes. Mahiesh just sat there and listened. Didn't interrupt, didn't check his phone, didn't tell me I was overreacting.

After my rant, he leaned back and said something that shifted my perspective completely. "Dude, this is nothing compared to your 12th board exams. Remember that? You studied six different subjects, wrote three-hour exams, dealt with pressure about your whole future. You survived that. This is tough, but you've handled worse. The pressure now is nothing compared to boards."

He was right. During boards, I studied 10-12 hours a day, solved hundreds of practice problems, wrote mock tests every week. Everyone kept saying "boards decide your future." And I got through it. I got into this college. So why was I letting these assignments break me?

We sat there for twenty minutes. He didn't solve my problems or do my assignments. He just reminded me of my own strength. Sometimes that's what friends are for—not to carry your burden, but to remind you that you're strong enough to carry it yourself.

After we talked, we both went back to studying. But something had changed. I wasn't just staring anymore—I was actually working. The assignments were still there, the presentation still looming, but the crushing weight had lifted enough for me to breathe.

What makes this special is our friendship dynamic. We sit next to each other in class, talk about life, our problems, frustrations. But he's also the guy who constantly annoys me. If I'm listening to music, he'll pull out my earphones. If I'm charging my laptop, he'll unplug it just to see me get mad. When stressed me called him, I half-expected him to crack a joke or tease me.

But he didn't. He showed up and was genuinely there for me. The person who usually makes my life difficult was the same person who helped me when I needed it most. That showed me a different side of him and changed how I see our friendship.

I finihed everything by the deadline. The algorithmic thinking summary, all ten Linear Algebra questions, the Burp Suite screenshots, the presentation, the battery technology project—all submitted on time. Not perfect, but done. That felt like a victory.

Looking back, that library conversation taught me something important. Life is full of ups and downs. There will be weeks where everything hits at once, moments where you feel like you're drowning. But getting into the pressure mindset—just spiraling and catastrophizing—doesn't help. You have to stay calm even when everything's chaotic.

I'm grateful to Mahilesh for being that calm presence. He didn't have to show up or listen to me vent. He could've said he was busy. But he chose to be there, and that made all the difference. That's real friendship—not Instagram-perfect, but the messy "I'll show up when you're falling apart" kind. And for that, I'll always be thankful.

Scenario 2
Adhi's Patient Teaching Changed Everything
Date: September 10th-15th, 2025

Between September 10th and September 15th, I had a Linear Algebra exam coming up, and I was genuinely struggling. Not the "I need to study more" kind of struggling, but the "I don't understand the fundamentals" kind that makes you feel stupid every time you look at your notes. The topics were row space, column space, null space, and subspace. On paper, they sound simple enough—spaces and matrices, how hard could it be? But when you're sitting with the textbook open and nothing is clicking, it's frustrating beyond words. That's when Adhi helped me, and I'll be forever grateful for his patience and willingness to teach.

Let me explain what was happening with Linear Algebra. We had two professors teaching us, and one of them was Zellam ma'am. I don't want to blame anyone, but I just couldn't understand her teaching method. Maybe it was her accent, maybe it was the pace, maybe it was just a mismatch between her teaching style and my learning style. Whatever it was, every class felt like I was hearing words without actually comprehending them. he'd write matrices on the board, talk about transformations, explain null spaces, and I'd be sitting there nodding like I understood, but internally I was completely lost.

The worst part was that I could mechanically solve some problems. Like, I'd see a question about finding the row space, and I'd follow the steps I'd memorized—reduce the matrix to row echelon form, identify the non-zero rows, those are your basis vectors for row space. I could do the steps, but I didn't understand WHY I was doing them. What even is a row space? Why does it matter? How does it connect to column space and null space? The concepts weren't sticking because I was just memorizing procedures without understanding the underlying logic.

I had asked a few classmates for help before Adhi. I went to Raghav first, then Pranay. Both are smart guys, and they genuinely tried to help. But the way they explained things was too complex for where I was at. They'd jump straight into advanced concepts, use mathematical terminology I didn't fully grasp, and assume I understood foundational things that I actually didn't. It's like trying to learn to run before you've learned to walk. Their explanations went over my head, and I felt even more confused after talking to them.

Then came the second test of the semester. We have four tests total in Linear Algebra, and this was test number two. I remember sitting in that exam hall, looking at the questions, and feeling my stomach drop. I knew I was unable to answer most of them properly. I could write something for each question, but I had zero confidence that my answers were right. When I walked out of that exam, I felt defeated. Not angry, not frustrated, just defeated. Like I was falling behind and couldn't catch up.

That's when Adhi comes into the picture. Adhi sits right next to me in class. He's a quiet guy—doesn't talk much, doesn't draw attention to himself. While I'm often distracted or scrolling through reels during boring lectures, he's always focused, always taking notes properly. And his marks? Always better than mine. Not just slightly better, but noticeably better. The kind of scores that make you realize he genuinely understands the material.

After that terrible test, I finally worked up the courage to ask Adhi for help. I'd asked him small questions before, so I knew he was a cool guy who wouldn't judge. I said something like, "Dude, I'm really struggling with these space concepts. Can you help me understand them?" And without hesitation, he said, "Okay, I will teach you."

We started meeting in the library and also during free periods in our classroom. The first session lasted about two hours, and Adhi literally started from the very beginning. That's what made his teaching different from Raghav's or Pranay's. He didn't assume I knew anything. He built up my understanding step by step, layer by layer.

I remember when he explained row space to me. He took out his notebook and drew simple diagrams. He explained that matrices are just collections of vectors, and row space is basically all the possible linear combinations you can make from the row vectors. He used this analogy about directions in space. He said, "Think about it like this—if you have two direction vectors, you can combine them to point in any direction within a certain plane. That's your row space. It's not some abstract mathematical thing; it's literally the space of all possible directions you can create."

That clicked. Finally, something clicked. Row space wasn't just a definition to memorize; it was a concept I could visualize. He then explained column space the same way, and suddenly I could see how they were related but different. Column space uses column vectors instead of row vectors—same principle, different orientation.

When we got to null space, I was nervous because that's the one that confused me the most. But Adhi was patient. He wrote down what null space actually means in simple terms. He said, "Null space is all the vectors that, when you multiply the matrix by them, give you zero. It's like finding the inputs that cancel everything out." He gave me specific examples, showed me how to solve for null space step by step, and made sure I understood each step before moving forward.

What I really appreciated about Adhi was his teaching style. He was incredibly patient. Every time I didn't understand something, I could tell him, and he wouldn't get frustrated or annoyed. He'd just explain it differently, use another example, break it down further. He never made me feel stupid for not getting it immediately. And as someone who's a visual learner himself, he incorporated diagrams, arrows, and spatial representations that made everything clearer.

He also helped me with memory techniques for remembering formulas. Linear Algebra has a lot of formulas, and I'd constantly mix them up. Adhi taught me mnemonics and tricks to remember which formula applies where. It sounds small, but those little memory aids made a huge difference during practice problems.

Before Adhi helped me, he was just the quiet guy who sat next to me and scored better marks. We were friendly, but not close. But spending those hours studying together, having him patiently explain things over and over until I understood, that changed our dynamic. We became close friends. I started appreciating not just his intelligence, but his kindness. He could've easily said he was too busy or just sent me his notes. But he chose to actually sit with me and teach. That takes time, effort, and genuine care.

I think he helped me because I asked him multiple times, and he's just a cool, helpful person by nature. Some people are naturally generous with their knowledge, and Adhi is one of them. He didn't expect anything in return, didn't ask me to do his assignments in exchange, didn't make a big deal about helping. He just did it because I needed help and he could provide it.

Did the help work? I don't have my exam results back yet, but I can tell you this—when I sat for the next assessment, I felt different. Instead of that sinking feeling of not knowing what to do, I looked at the questions and could actually think through them. I understood what was being asked. I knew which concepts to apply. I might not have aced it, but I definitely did much better than the previous test where I bombed almost everything.

This experience with Adhi taught me something valuable about asking for help and about teaching. Sometimes you need to find the right person who can explain things at your level. It's not that Raghav or Pranay were bad explainers; they just weren't the right match for where I was at. Adhi met me where I was and built me up from there. That's what good teaching looks like.

It also made me want to pay it forward. Adhi helped me without expecting anything back, and that inspired me. Now, when I see classmates struggling with concepts I understand, I try to help them the way Adhi helped me. Not by giving them answers, but by actually explaining the concepts patiently until they get it. That's the kind of positive cycle I want to be part of.

I'm genuinely grateful to Adhi for taking the time to teach me. Those two-hour sessions, the patient explanations, the visual diagrams, the memory tricks—all of it helped me not just pass a test, but actually understand Linear Algebra. And beyond academics, it showed me the value of patience and genuine kindness. Not everyone would take two hours out of their day to help a classmate who's struggling. Adhi did, and that's something I won't forget.


Scenario 3
Mr. Sibi's Guidance During SIH Confusion
Date: September 14th, 2025

September 14th was chaotic for multiple reasons, but one of the most stressful moments was dealing with our Smart India Hackathon problem statement crisis. SIH—Smart India Hackathon—is this huge hackathon conducted by the Indian Government where student teams solve real problems submitted by big companies and government organizations. It's a big deal, and our team "Hustle Squad" had already finalized our problem statement weeks ago. We thought we were all set. But then Mr. Sibi, our mentor, told us we needed to change it at the last minute, and I panicked. Looking back now, I'm incredibly grateful for his guidance during those stressful hours, because he helped us find a much better problem that actually made sense for first-year students.

Let me give some context about our team first. Team Hustle Squad consisted of six members: me (S. Ashvinsai) as team leader, Mahilesh P, Vishaak K.K., S. Shivani Sree, Adhi Arunasalam A, and B. Sanjai. We're all first-year B.Tech Cyber Security students, which means our technical knowledge is limited to what we learned in school and the few months of college so far. We're eager and motivated, but we're also realistic about our capabilities.

Our original problem statement was about developing a travel-related software app for mobile phones that could capture trip-related information. Problem statement number 25082. When we first selected it, it seemed perfect—an app, something we could build, travel is something everyone relates to, seemed doable. We spent time discussing features, how we'd implement it, what technologies we'd use. We were getting excited about it.

But then Mr. Sibi called me. It was September 14th, around 5 PM, and I was on the bus heading to class. When I answered, he got straight to the point. he said we needed to reconsider our problem statement. he explained that for our travel app to actually work and be useful, we'd need access to reliable, real-time data like what Google Maps uses. We'd need traffic details, location tracking, route optimization algorithms—all things that require massive databases and infrastructure that we, as first-year students, simply don't have access to.

he then pointed out the bigger issue: there's nothing innovative about what we were planning. Google Maps exists. Uber exists. There are already dozens of apps that do exactly what our problem statement was asking for, and they do it with million-dollar budgets and years of development. What were we, six first-year students with basic coding knowledge, going to add that doesn't already exist? Our solution would just be a worse version of something that's already out there.

That hit hard. he was absolutely right, but it also meant we had to start over. And here's where the panic set in: we had only two to three hours to select a new problem statement and submit it through the Microsoft Forms. Two to three hours to undo weeks of planning and find something completely new. The deadline was strict—8 PM that evening.

I immediately started messaging everyone in the team. "We need a new problem statement NOW. Start looking. Send suggestions." We were all in different places—some on buses, some at home, some already in class. The coordination was chaotic. Everyone started browsing through the SIH problem statement list, sending ideas back and forth in our WhatsApp group.

During this whole chaos, I stayed on the phone with mr. Sibi. he wasn't just telling us "find something else"—he was actually guiding us through the thought process. He asked questions that made us think differently about what we should be looking for. he said, "As first-year students, what do you actually have? You have enthusiasm, you have basic programming skills, you have fresh perspectives. What you don't have is access to enterprise-level data or years of specialized knowledge. So find a problem that plays to your strengths, not your weaknesses."

He asked us, "What technologies are you learning right now in your courses? What interests your team? What problems can you solve with the resources you actually have?" These questions shifted our whole approach. Instead of picking something that sounded cool but was unrealistic, we started looking for problems that matched our actual skill level.

We went through about ten different problem statements. Some were too hardware-focused—we're software people. Some required knowledge of specific industries we knew nothing about. Some were just too complex for first-years to handle. We kept eliminating options, getting more and more stressed as the clock ticked.

Then Mahilesh, who probably has the most technical knowledge among all of us, found it: Problem Statement SIH25049—"AI-Driven Public Health Chatbot for Disease Awareness." It was in the healthcare category, and when we read through it, something clicked.

The problem was about creating a chatbot that could provide information about diseases, vaccination schedules, and health awareness, specifically targeting remote and rural areas. The key part was that it could work through WhatsApp and SMS—meaning people wouldn't need to download a special app or have great internet. In rural Odisha and other remote parts of India, people might not have smartphones or reliable data, but most people have basic phones with SMS capability or WhatsApp on 2G/3G.

Mahilesh said he could build this. He'd been learning about chatbot frameworks, API integrations, and natural language processing basics. This was something where we could actually use AI tools that are already available—we didn't need to build AI from scratch. We could use existing large language models and train/customize them for health information specific to India. We could integrate with WhatsApp Business API and SMS gateways. The data we'd need—vaccination schedules, common disease information, government health schemes—was all publicly available information.

mr. Sibi's response when we proposed this was encouraging. he said, "Now this makes sense. This has potential." he explained why: AI and chatbots are hot topics right now. Healthcare 
accessibility is a real problem in rural India. The solution is innovative because most health information systems require apps or websites, but this would meet people where they already are—on 
WhatsApp and SMS. We weren't trying to compete with Google; we were trying to solve a genuine problem that existing solutions haven't addressed well.

he also pointed out that this problem had real social impact. If we could create a chatbot that helps even a few hundred people in remote villages get accurate information about vaccinations or disease symptoms, that's genuinely valuable. It's not just a technical project; it's something that could actually help people. That motivated all of us.

We finalized our decision. I filled out the Microsoft Forms, submitted problem statement SIH25049, and felt this weird mix of relief and anxiety. Relief because we'd made the deadline. Anxiety because we'd just committed to building something completely different from what we'd planned for weeks.

What I'm most grateful for is how mr. Sibi handled the situation. he could've just let us continue with the travel app and let us fail or struggle. But he cared enough to intervene, even at the last minute. he didn't just say "this is wrong, find something else." he guided us through the thinking process. he asked questions that made us evaluate our options critically. he helped us understand not just what to build, but why certain choices were better than others.

His mentorship taught me something important about decision-making, especially in technical projects. It's easy to get excited about an idea that sounds cool or impressive. But you have to 
honestly assess: Do I have the resources to do this? Does this solution already exist? Am I adding value or just recreating something worse? These are hard questions, but they're necessary.

The SIH project is still ongoing. We're working on developing the chatbot, integrating it with WhatsApp, training it on health data specific to Indian context. It's challenging, but it feels meaningful. Every time we work on it, I remember that afternoon on the bus, the panic of having three hours to pivot completely, and mr. Sibi's calm guidance through the chaos.

I'm grateful to mr. Sibi for pushing us to think critically and for not letting us pursue a doomed project just because we'd already invested time in it. Sometimes the best mentorship isn't
about encouragement; it's about honest, timely intervention. he saw something we couldn't see, spoke up even though it created short-term stress, and ultimately guided us toward something better. That's what good mentors do—they don't just support your decisions; they challenge you to make better ones.
