# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

This week was absolutely brutal - 4 assignments + presentation + group project all at once. I was literally about to lose it. 
Thank god for Mahilesh though. He found me in the library when I was basically having a breakdown and just... sat there. Didn't try to fix anything, just listened. Reminded me I've handled worse. Idk, sometimes that's all you need.

Adhi's been such a lifesaver. He noticed I was drowning in that Linear Algebra subject and just handed me his notes, no questions asked. Even stayed after class to explain stuff. People like that are gold.

Met with Mr. Sibi about SIH today. Went in completely clueless about which problem statement to pick. he didn't just tell me what to do though - asked questions that actually made me think. Left feeling way more clear about the direction.
