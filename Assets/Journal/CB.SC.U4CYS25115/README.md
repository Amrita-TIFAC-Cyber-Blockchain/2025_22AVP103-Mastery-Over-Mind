## Journal Record
**Scenario 1:**-

I am thank full to my senior anna , Because on the orientation day I didn’t  get any email from amrita about the orientation and I had call to the administration they told me the date of the orientation so I came here on the 8 of august then I do not have any idea what to do then at people who are there at gate they helped me to get the admit card when I entered the college it is time for the orientation till that time I did not know that I should upload all the document should be uploaded in the  Swagatham  portal on that same day my father had a return train due to urgent work he had to return back I did not have my document verification on that day my dad was thinking that what should we do now ,he was in tension then my approach some senior and asked him would he could help us in any think . then he asked what happened explain me he asked then my dad to tell him everything what happened and my dad told everything. the senior anna said that sir you for the 6:30 train I will take care of him. My dad left that night. Next day senior anna called me said that at sharp 9:30 you came to the orientation place at the pandal 
When I reach there the faculty over there had me to come at 2:30 after the mess. At 2:30 I was having my campus tour then I these staff I have told to my senior then he said no problem I will take you the campus tour, it is time for the orientation he had taken all my document and uploaded it into the swagatham portal. When it was time for my document verification there was some problem that my photo was not properly uploaded the he taken me out side and retake my photo. my verification was completed. I am very thanking full to the my senior anna who had help me at that time 






**Scenario 2:**

I want to express my gratitude to my friend Sahith. He has helped me countless times by lending me money whenever I need it. No matter the situation, he never hesitates. He would always say, “We are going to stay here together for four years — you can repay me anytime.” That simple line shows me how generous and understanding he is.



One of my favorite memories was with him, during our midterm exams. I was used to spending the whole day in his room, studying together. His calm presence and focus helped me stay motivated. What I like most about Sahith is his kindness, patience, and the way he always makes others feel supported.



He never made me feel bad for asking for help. He trusts me a lot in any situation, and i also have the same trust in him. Studying with him made difficult exams feel easier. He is just a genuine  and good person who looks out for his friends.



gHe is just a genuine and ood person who looks out for his friends. His support has been a huge part of my college life. He always shares what he has without a second thought, and i also share everything with him, every point. I always felt comfortable coming into his room. Getting a friend like him is one of the best things that has happened to me and in my life. He does not only talk like a good friend; he proves it. I really appreciate how he always stays positive with everyone and in any situation, even during stressful exams.I have learned a lot from him about being a calm and focused person. He’s the kind of person you can trust, no matter what. My college experience would not be the same without him.







I’m lucky to have a friend like him.



**Scenario 3:**

I want to express my gratitude to my roommate, Sridhar. He has always been there to help me, especially when it comes to booking the train tickets. Every time I needed his help.



I still remember the time of Dussehra, when we suddenly got two extra days of holiday. I couldn't find any train to travel to Visakhapatnam, but at that time Sridhar had helped me a lot in booking the ticket for me to go home. That moment I really felt his helpfulness.



And that is just one example. He is the only person I am stressed about exams or just need someone to talk to - he is always understanding and ready to listen and talk.

He never makes me feel like I am bothering him or disturbing him at any time, no matter what I am asking him. i know that in any situation of my life, there is one person who can help me. He is one of the most balanced people I have ever met. He makes me feel like he is my family member, and , when i am far away from my family, at that time, I feel that I am still with my family members. He makes the hostel room feel more like a home.He is good at solving any problem, like those train ticket bookings. If someone needs any help from him, he will help them out without expecting anything in return from that person. His calm attitude helps me feel less stressed out too. i am very happy to have such a friend. He’s not just a roommate; he’s a truly good friend.



I truly appreciate his kindness and his selfless nature. He’s always ready to help anyone without any greed. Having a roommate like him has made my hostel life so much happier, and I'm just really thankful to have him as a friend.
