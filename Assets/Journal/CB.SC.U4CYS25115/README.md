# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
scenario 1 :-
I want to express my gratitude to my friend Srihas, who sits beside me in class. From the very beginning of my journey at Amrita, whenever I faced any difficulty in understanding something, he would patiently explain it to me in a very simple manner, without any hesitation.
I still remember one day in math class when I couldn’t understand a particular problem. I asked him multiple times, and without any anger or frustration, he explained it to me again and again. What I admire most in him is his patience and willingness to help others.


scenario 2 :-
I want to express my gratitude to my friend Sahith. He has helped me countless times by lending me money whenever I was in need. No matter the situation, he never hesitated. He would always say, “We’re going to be here together for four years — you can repay me anytime.” That simple line showed me how generous and understanding 
One of my favorite memories with him is during our midterm exams. I used to spend the whole day in his room, studying together. His calm presence and focus helped me stay motivated. What I like most about Sahith is his kindness, patience, and the way he always makes others feel supported.
I’m lucky to have a friend like him.

scenario 3 :-
I want to express my gratitude to my roommate, Sridhar. He has always been there to help me, especially when it comes to booking train tickets. Every time I needed help.
I still remember during Dussehra, we suddenly got two extra days of holiday. I couldn’t find any train to Visakhapatnam, but Sridhar stepped in and managed to book a ticket for me to get home. That moment really showed me his helpful and caring nature.
And it’s not just that one time — he has supported me in many situations. I truly appreciate his kindness and the way he’s always ready to help.
