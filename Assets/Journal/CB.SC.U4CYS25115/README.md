# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
scenario 1 :-
I want to express my gratitude to my friend Srihas, who sits beside me in class. From the very beginning of my journey at Amrita, whenever I faced any difficulty in understanding something, he would patiently explain it to me in a very simple manner, without any hesitation.
I still remember one day in math class when I couldn’t understand a particular problem. I asked him multiple times, and without any anger or frustration, he explained it to me again and again. What I admire most in him is his patience and willingness to help others.
He never makes me feel silly for not understanding something. His help has made me feel more confident in my classes. I am really lucky to have him as my friend and desk partner. He is a very kind person who truly cares about people. His support has made my whole journey at Amrita much better.
He is smart, but he's also humble and approachable. He always makes sure I've understood before moving on. It's great to have someone so dependable sitting right next to me. His positive attitude makes even difficult classes more enjoyable. I've learned just as much from his kindness as I have from his explanations.


scenario 2 :-
You got it. Here is the message with five additional lines:
I want to express my gratitude to my friend Sahith. He has helped me countless times by lending me money whenever I was in need. No matter the situation, he never hesitated. He would always say, “We’re going to be here together for four years — you can repay me anytime.” That simple line showed me how generous and understanding he is.
One of my favorite memories with him is during our midterm exams. I used to spend the whole day in his room, studying together. His calm presence and focus helped me stay motivated. What I like most about Sahith is his kindness, patience, and the way he always makes others feel supported.
He never made me feel bad for asking for help. His trust in me always meant a lot. Studying with him made difficult exams feel easier. He is just a genuinely good person who looks out for his friends. His support has been a huge part of my college life. He always shares what he has without a second thought. I always felt comfortable and welcome in his room. His friendship is one of the best things about my time here. He doesn't just talk about being a good friend; he shows it. I really appreciate how he always stayed positive, even during stressful exams.I've learned a lot from him about being a calm and focused person. He’s the kind of friend you know you can trust on, no matter what. My college experience wouldn't be the same without him.

I’m lucky to have a friend like him.

scenario 3 :-
I want to express my gratitude to my roommate, Sridhar. He has always been there to help me, especially when it comes to booking train tickets. Every time I needed help.
I still remember during Dussehra, we suddenly got two extra days of holiday. I couldn’t find any train to Visakhapatnam, but Sridhar stepped in and managed to book a ticket for me to get home. That moment really showed me his helpful and caring nature.
And that's just one example. It’s not just that one time; he has supported me in so many other situations, big and small. Whether I'm stressed about exams or just need someone to talk to, he's always understanding and ready to listen.
He never makes me feel like I'm bothering him, no matter what I ask. I know I can always count on him when I'm in a tough spot. He is one of the most reliable people I've ever met. Living away from home is much easier with him around. He just makes the hostel feel more like a home.he maintain the cleaness in the room.He's great at figuring out practical problems, like those train bookings. He shares things without expecting anything in return. His calm attitude helps me feel less stressed out too. I'm really glad we ended up as roommates. He’s not just a roommate; he’s a truly good friend.
I truly appreciate his kindness and his selfless nature. He’s always ready to help anyone without a second thought. Having a roommate like him has made my hostel life so much better, and I'm just really thankful to have him as a friend.
