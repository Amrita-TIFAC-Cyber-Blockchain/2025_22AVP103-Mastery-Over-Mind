# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
SCENERIO 1:
A few weeks back,
We had to travel in a combined bus, since the number of students in P.N Pudur bus and Vadavalli bus have reduced. Initially they had designated our bus, Vadavalli bus, for transport and we have been allocated permanent seats to avoid confusion. However one day, from the college back home, when we got on the bus we saw people already sitting in our spot. We were pretty confused but thankfully before things escalated, one of the students from our bus who I beleive is a M.Tech student, politely informed them that those were our seats and even helped them find other seats. And she continued to allocate seats for people in the absence of our teacher in charge. I truely felt thankful especially considering that I can be pretty bad at talking to strangers.

SCENERIO 2:
Last month,
Before the mid-semesters, there were two schedules sent; an older one and a revised new one. According to the revised schedule which we were supposed to follow, the exam was preponed a day before, while in the old time table it was a day after. I had accidently referred to the old timetable, and was still studying. Thankfully my friend called me to check and that's when i realised i had been looking at the wrong timetable. Moreover, the shift i had was in the afternoon, so i managed to make it to the campus on time and write the exam.

SCENERIO 3:
A few months back,
For some reason all of a sudden the outlets in one column of benches of our class stopped working. That evening we couldn't charge our laptops and had to take turns to charge using the one outlet near the switches that worked. It made finishing our assignments very difficult. So we went and informed the person in charge regarding the issue. The next morning the issue got resolved and we continued our lab sessions without a hitch. And so, I m grateful for the staff to take immediate action and resolve the issue by the next day.
