Gratitude journal :

Iam thankful for Pragadheesh who helped me with medicine and food when i was not well , he helped me when i needed it the most . As i was having fever over 104 and without his medicines my situation would have been very bad .
next to my other friends , Arul and Sreekanth , on the day that i had fever , i was not able to get up from my bed , too tired to go to the canteen so i asked if arul and sreekanth can buy me food from the canteen , and they did , that was a very important help .
Shabarish , sreehari , faheem - these guy accompanied me to the clinic in the night .
Pranay - He took care of me leaving to the home on the day of fever and after I returned he took care of the medical certificate .
Chunganth Srinivasan Sir - He gave me plenty of time to submit my assignment understanding the situation.
