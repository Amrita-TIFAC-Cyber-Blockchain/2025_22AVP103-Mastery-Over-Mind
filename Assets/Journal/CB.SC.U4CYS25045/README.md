For Amma(Mata Amritanandamayi Devi),
   Whenever I think about who brings peace and direction into my life, the first person that comes to my mind is Amma — Mata Amritanandamayi Devi. Even though I haven’t met her in person, she feels like someone who’s always with me, quietly guiding me through everything I do. There’s something about her that’s beyond words — this calm, loving energy that just makes you feel safe and understood.

Whenever I see Amma’s smile in photos or videos, I feel an instant sense of comfort. It’s like all the noise in my mind just fades for a while. She doesn’t even have to speak — her presence itself is enough to remind me that everything will be okay. I think that’s the kind of love and peace only someone truly selfless can give.

College life can be stressful at times — there are exams, deadlines, projects, and all the small worries that pile up. But when I think of Amma, I’m reminded to slow down and focus on what really matters. She makes me realize that life isn’t just about marks or achievements; it’s about being a good human being. Her teachings remind me to stay kind, patient, and grounded even when things don’t go my way.

Sometimes when I walk around campus and see her pictures or hear people talk about her, I feel this quiet warmth inside. Amma’s love seems to fill the whole place — it makes the college feel more like home. There’s a peaceful energy here that feels like her blessing. It’s almost like she’s silently watching over everyone, guiding us without saying a word.

What I love most about Amma is how simple her message is — love and serve others selflessly. It sounds so small, but it’s actually everything. Whenever I get upset or impatient, I remind myself of Amma’s calmness and compassion. She teaches me that strength doesn’t come from being loud or powerful — it comes from staying kind and humble no matter what.

I’ve read about how Amma hugs thousands of people, one after another, without getting tired. Just thinking about that amazes me. It’s not just a hug — it’s her way of healing people, of reminding them that they are loved. That level of love is something I deeply admire. I hope that one day, I can be even a little like her — someone who makes others feel seen and cared for.

Even though I’ve never spoken to Amma, I feel connected to her. Sometimes, when I’m anxious or sad, I just close my eyes and think of her face. It’s strange how just that small thought makes my heart feel lighter. It feels like she’s silently saying, “Don’t worry, I’m here.” That kind of invisible strength is so special.

Amma’s teachings have also changed the way I look at success. She’s made me realize that being a good person is more important than being the best person. She reminds me that real growth isn’t just in knowledge but in kindness. Whenever I face challenges, I try to think — “What would Amma do?” And the answer is almost always simple: stay calm, stay kind, and keep loving anyway.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to actually meet her. I think I wouldn’t even be able to say much — I’d probably just smile or cry and say thank you. Because honestly, how do you thank someone who’s touched your life without even meeting you? She’s like a silent strength in my life — always there, even when I don’t realize it.

There’s a quote of Amma’s that I really love: “When love overflows and is expressed through every word and action, that is real devotion.” That line stays with me. It makes me want to bring that same love into the little things I do every day — helping someone without being asked, listening without judging, or just being more patient.

Amma has taught me that spirituality isn’t about rituals or distance from the world. It’s about how we live, how we treat people, and how much love we put into what we do. That’s such a grounding thought, especially in a world that often feels busy and competitive. She reminds me that it’s okay to slow down, to breathe, and to choose kindness.

Writing this now, I realize how grateful I am to have Amma’s presence in my life, even from afar. She’s like the soft background music that makes everything feel calm and balanced. Amma has helped me see that the real purpose of life is to be kind, to care, and to make others happy in whatever small ways we can.

So today, I just want to say thank you, Amma — for all your love, even from a distance. Thank you for being a quiet source of strength, for reminding me to look beyond grades and achievements, and for helping me focus on becoming a better person every day. You make me want to live with more love, more patience, and more gratitude.

For Ramaguru sir,
  I'm super thankful for Ramaguru Sir, who teaches our MAOM classes. His calm and balanced way of teaching meditation has really changed the way I approach my day. Before, I used to stress easily, but through his guidance, I've learned to slow down, breathe, and stay calm. The way he speaks and handles things just gives offf such a peaceful vibe.

For Anushree and Kavya,
  I want to express my gratitude for the two wonderful friends who make every day special. Their support, laughter, and constant encouragement mean more to me than words can say. Whenever I felt tired or lonely, they were always there with a smile, a joke, or a helping hand. They’ve shared their food with me, brought delicious dishes from their homes.They’ve made my days lighter and my journey more joyful.I’m especially thankful for how they’ve helped me in my studies — teaching me and staying calm and clearing my endless doubts and guiding me through many other subjects with patience and encouragement. Their support has helped me learn better and stay motivated.
