For Amma(Mata Amritanandamayi Devi),
   I'm deeply grateful to Amma and all the love and guidance that she brings into my life. Even though I dont get the opportunity to meeet her in person ,her wisdom and compassion constantly inspire me to stay grounded, kind and selfless. Her energy reminds me to look beyond grades and acheivements, and focus mainly on becoming a better person. Amma truly makes the college feel like home.She's like a silent strength in the background, reminding me to stay kind and grounded no matter what.

For Ramaguru sir,
  I'm super thankful for Ramaguru Sir, who teaches our MAOM classes. His calm and balanced way of teaching meditation has really changed the way I approach my day. Before, I used to stress easily, but through his guidance, I've learned to slow down, breathe, and stay calm. The way he speaks and handles things just gives offf such a peaceful vibe.

For Anushree and Kavya,
  I want to express my gratitude for the two wonderful friends who make every day special. Their support, laughter, and constant encouragement mean more to me than words can say. Whenever I felt tired or lonely, they were always there with a smile, a joke, or a helping hand. They’ve shared their food with me, brought delicious dishes from their homes.They’ve made my days lighter and my journey more joyful.I’m especially thankful for how they’ve helped me in my studies — teaching me and staying calm and clearing my endless doubts and guiding me through many other subjects with patience and encouragement. Their support has helped me learn better and stay motivated.
