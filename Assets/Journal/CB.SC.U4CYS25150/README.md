# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
3 instances of people helping me in Amrita:

1. Last month, I was a little late for the afternoon shuttle bus after lunch from hostel to class. I was so sure I would miss the bus but the driver was kind enough to wait for me . There was no one else on the bus, he could've easily said this bus doesn't run right now but he asked me which stop and although mine was the last, he still started the bus and dropped me off at the right building. His kind actions made my day and I'm grateful to have met him.

2. The very first week in Amrita, the huge campus confused me and I was lost but hesitant to ask for directions from seniors who were obviously strangers to me. But a sweet and friendly senior approached me and helped me out without me ever having to say a word to her. Her being so welcoming made me feel a lot less stressed about being here. Little things like this make me happy to be here. I'm grateful things turned out the way they did and I'm really grateful for having met her.

3. In august, I fell sick. They took care of me like family, bringing me food, medicines, and even making sure I stayed hydrated. They checked on me so often that I never felt alone, even when I was feeling weak and tired. Their small acts of kindness, like making soup, tidying my space, and keeping things quiet so I could rest, it meant so much. It reminded me how lucky I am to live with such caring and genuine people. I’ll always remember their thoughtfulness and how it made recovery so much easier. I’m feeling deeply thankful for my roommates.
