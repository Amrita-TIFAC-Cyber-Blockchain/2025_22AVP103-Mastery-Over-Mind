I'm greatful to have Ajay as my senior .
He guided me through how thing work here in Amrita .He helped me with academics. Thought me how to manage both academics and extra curricular activities. One day i was in library preparing for modern physics test which was happening the next day. I was frustrated while preparing. He made me understand the concepts . Through his guidance i performed well in that test
