Gratitude Journal Entry 1 
Date: 09/08/2007:
1st day in hostel : 
I am thankful for my friends in college, mainly Gagana , Keerthi Niharika ,  Harshini and Sruthi . After 6 months in the house they made my first day hostel very comfortable . I never expected that night would run that happiest . The way they speak and make fun makes them so comfortable with them . I was afraid before coming to the hostel , how can I be there in the hostel but they made me lose that fear. Till now that bond is like that only I feel soo happy by that .

Friday afternoon we were having only one class was there so I took my bag to hostel at lunch break but the time was so less . At that time I was so worried of taking my bag again to college but valli understood my problem and took my bag . Even though she had some body pains she took my bag and kept in my room . I was so thankful to her on that day

After coming from Dasara vaishnavi man said we have to give a printout of project zero given before holidays . I am in the hostel I need a printout immediately because in the morning 1st period only we have to submit the printout but it was nearly the closing time of the printing shop . At that time  called Rohith for help ,  immediately he said said send me soft copy I will get it , i didn't expect that response from him . He helped me out of  that problem. I was so thankful to him that day .
