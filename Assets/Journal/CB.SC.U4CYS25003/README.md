1. Gratitude to Mahilesh :

When I first started college, I didn't expect the journey to be so overwhelming. Everything was new: the campus, the classes, and the people. Managing the pressure of assignments was tough, and there were days when I felt like giving up. That’s when I realized how lucky I was to have someone like Mahilesh by my side. He is the one person who can make me smile, even during the hardest moments.

I still remember a day after our internal exams. I hadn’t done well in one of my core subjects and felt really upset about it. I sat quietly in the canteen, feeling disappointed and frustrated. Out of nowhere, Mahilesh came over and said something completely random and funny, and within seconds, we were both laughing uncontrollably. That’s who he is—a person who won’t let me sink into negativity. His laughter is contagious, his attitude is always light, and he reminds me that no failure is permanent. What I admire most about him is how he turns every situation into something positive. His optimism has become something I lean on more than I ever realized. Now, whenever I face challenges, whether academic or personal, I think about how Mahilesh would handle them: with a smile and a joke, but also with strength. Whenever I look back, I see how his presence has made my first semester lighter and happier. My gratitude to Mahilesh is beyond words.

2. Gratitude to Ashwin Sai:

The first few days of college were nerve-wracking. I was surrounded by new faces, new teachers, and a completely unfamiliar environment. I’m naturally quiet, so making friends didn't come easily. That’s when I met Ashwin Sai, my first friend in college, who honestly made my whole transition easier.

Ashwin was the first one to speak to me in class. I still remember his friendly smile when he asked if he could sit beside me during our orientation session. From that moment, things began to change. He made me feel included and comfortable when I was too shy to start a conversation. Slowly, I started to open up, talk more, and even join group discussions, something I never did before.

He has a unique way of connecting with people. Whether it’s during lab hours, lunch breaks, or group projects, he always keeps everyone engaged. There were days when I sat alone, scrolling through my phone, but Ashwin would come over, drag me to join the group, and introduce me to others. Because of him, I met so many people and shared in many fun moments. Now, when I walk around campus with my group of friends, I often think—if Ashwin hadn’t talked to me that day, I might still be that quiet student sitting in the corner. He was the bridge between my hesitation and the friendships I cherish now. I’m deeply grateful to Ashwin for helping me socialize and for being my first real connection in this new chapter of life.

3. Gratitude to Lokesh and Yashwanth:

When I first met Lokesh and Yashwanth, I was nervous. They spoke Telugu, while I spoke Tamil, and I thought it would be hard to communicate. But what happened next surprised me. Even with language barriers, we built one of the most genuine friendships I’ve ever had.

It started with small things: simple smiles during class, helping each other with lab tasks, and sharing snacks during breaks. Slowly, we began to talk in broken English, mixing in bits of Tamil and Telugu. Sometimes our conversations turned into hilarious combinations of all three languages, but the laughter that followed made everything worth it.

What touched me most was their effort to include me. They never made me feel left out, even when I couldn’t understand some Telugu jokes. Instead, they would patiently explain or switch to English, ensuring I was part of the moment. That effort meant a lot. It showed me that true friendship doesn’t depend on language but on connection, kindness, and understanding. Today, when I think about Lokesh and Yashwanth, I feel thankful. They showed me that friendship has no boundaries. Their kindness broke down the barrier I once thought existed. I’ve learned that what connects people isn’t just the ability to speak the same language, but the willingness to understand each other’s hearts.
