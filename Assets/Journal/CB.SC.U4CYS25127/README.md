# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

I would like to express my heartful thanks and gratitude to the canteen staffs. During hectic lunch hours, the canteen becomes an apocalypse of students rushing into the billing section to place their orders. Yet, the billing staffs and others in the canteen manage the crowd very well and make sure that  everyone's order gets delivered to them and no one's order get mismatched. I noticed this last month and this happens everyday. So I thank them for the job they're doing, Thank you !!

Next I would like to thank Mr. Srinivasan, our maths lecturer. We all love his teaching and he breaks the content and teaches us in parts so that we understand every bit of the portion that he's taking. Last week he took first 2 periods of Tuesday but we never felt the heat. So I would like to thank him !!

Lastly, I would like to thank my Class Advisor Mr. Praveen. Last month I had to get the Bonafide from the college administration for my address proof and though he had and was busy with his other works. He dedicated a bit of his time to my query and responded to it so that I got my Bonafide approved on time and I've completed my passport registration process on time. Thank you sir !!
