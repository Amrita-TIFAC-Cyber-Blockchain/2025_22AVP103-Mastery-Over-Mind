# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

First of all, I am grateful for our Maths Professor. He is the professor for my toughest subject, and I was genuinely convinced I'd fail. But he has
this way of explaining complex ideas in his office hours that just clicks. He never makes me feel stupid for asking basic questions, and his patience
is just… endless. He doesn't just teach the syllabus, he really makes an effort to make us understand it.
Secondly, My hostel mate Arul. He’s the one who knows exactly when I’m getting too stressed during a late-night study and enjoys watching movies
together.
Lastly, I'm grateful for worker in the canteen. At lunchtime, it is pure mayhem-no one has any patience, they all seem stressed-but he's always there
at his station with the biggest, most genuine smile. He serves everyone so warmly and kindly, asking how our day is. That small, consistent moment of
Positivity in the midst of a frenetic day truly makes all the difference.
