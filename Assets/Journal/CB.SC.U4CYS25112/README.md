  to maths sir :
 Gratitude Journal – To My Maths Sir

Today, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my Maths sir, whose teaching has truly made a difference in my learning journey. His classes are not just about solving equations or memorizing formulas, but about understanding the deeper connection between mathematics and the real world. Every time he teaches a new concept, he relates it to practical applications and even connects it with future technologies, which makes the subject far more interesting and meaningful.

One thing that stands out about him is his ability to make even the toughest topics seem simple. He patiently explains every step, ensuring that no one is left confused.he took extra time time in solving sums that i asked for which is not included in syllabus and brought through my own intrest and he will tell some brain storming topics to learn further by knowing my intrest so i thanked hin at the day he took matrix transformation before midsemester

 to Amit sir :
Today, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my POE sir. His way of teaching has truly helped me understand the practical side of circuits and connections. Before his classes, I used to think that circuits were only about theory and formulas. But after learning from him, I started to see how everything we study actually works in real life.beyond he accepted the permission granted to work extra time in engineering lab AB2 and assigned lab assistant staff to take care which admires a lot.
Sir always makes the subject interesting by giving real-life examples. Whenever he teaches a new topic, he relates it to how we use it in daily life or in real engineering projects. The time when he explains about sensors or connections, he shows how they are used in machines or devices that we use every day. This makes the topic easier to understand and more meaningful.
I also enjoy the lab sessions a lot because of him. Working with the equipment, connecting wires, and testing circuits make me feel like a real engineer. I remember thanking him after our second lab session after the Dasara holidays because that day I realized how much I was enjoying learning this subject.

   to english mam:
 Today, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my English ma’am. Her teaching has really helped me improve my communication skills and boosted my confidence in speaking. Before attending her classes, I was not very comfortable speaking in front of others and has language barriers . I often worried about making mistakes in grammar or pronunciation. But her way of teaching made me feel more confident and interested in learning English.beyond she give me some tips to enhance my spoken skills
There was one time when I had to give a speech in class, and I got stuck in the middle. I felt nervous and thought I had failed. But instead of scolding me or ignoring it, ma’am smiled and motivated me. She told me not to give up and said that everyone learns by trying again. She gave me another chance to speak, and that time, I felt more confident and did much better. That moment made me realize how kind and supportive she is.
I still remember thanking her in the language lab before our internal exams. I told her how much she had helped me in improving my speaking and writing skills. She was very happy and told me to keep practicing and never stop learning. Her kind words gave me more motivation to work harder.
