# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
SCENARIO 1
To: Anjana
Date : 17/10/2025
For my modern physics mid semester test i was really tensed as i only had vague idea about the last chapter. The day before exam my hostel-mate Anjana taught me that chapter very well which really helped understand it very well. Even on the day of exam right before entering the exam hall she made sure that i knew well all the concepts and that i knew how to do the important question. I am grateful to Anjana for her help that day without i would have lost all marks for that chapter.

SCENARIO 2
To: Sathvika, Hema, Navya
Date : 08/10/2025
I was having heavy fever which made me really homesick. I was very frustrated, sad and also tensed about the upcoming exams. My roommates were very sweet and they cared for me when i was sick and kept me happy so that i would not be homesick. They cracked jokes, played games and also we had group study sessions. My roommate Sathvika kept the room lively and fun which helped me very much to get over my homesickness. I am grateful for my roommates to think about me and help me feel happy through a tough phase.

SCENARIO 3
To : Research student
Date:17/09/2025
One day we had POE lab but me and my teammates were not able to finish the lab work since the output was not getting displayed. After almost an hour only we got to know that machine was faulty and the issues were not with our connections. By then it was time for us to leave and we couldn't do anything. The research student who helps us with our lab activities was not able to help us much that day since many students were already waiting for her help. She felt bad for us and after lab called us and explained all the connections very well for our teammates which helped us do it better when we got time again in the lab. If she was not there we would have left that lab activity without understanding anything and getting bad marks for the viva. I am grateful to her for taking time to help us understand the lab activity even after the class got over.
