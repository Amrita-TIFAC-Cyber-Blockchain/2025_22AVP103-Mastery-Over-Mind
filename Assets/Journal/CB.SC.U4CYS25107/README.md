# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind

## Journal Record
Date: November 11, 2025
Today, I would like to thank:

Vishali sister , 
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my senior, Vishali, who is also the daughter of my mother’s friend. During my Modern Physics mid-term examination, I urgently needed a calculator for the next day’s exam. Without any hesitation, she arranged a calculator for me overnight and made sure I had exactly what I needed in time.

Her quick response, willingness to help, and caring nature truly meant a lot to me in that stressful moment. Even though she is a third-year senior with her own responsibilities and workload, she still took the effort to support me.

I deeply appreciate her kindness and the way she stepped in when I needed help. I’m genuinely grateful for her support.

A random senior ,
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to a senior whom I met as a random passer-by during my first visit to Amrita for certificate verification. Even though he didn’t know me and was not part of the student volunteer team, he still took the time to guide me in every way he could. He showed me the route to the xerox office and the canteen, and even offered me stationery items personally to make things easier for me.

His kindness, patience, and willingness to help a new student—despite having no obligation to do so—truly made that day much smoother and more comforting. I genuinely appreciate his support and the positive impact he had on my experience.

Rithaaesh , 
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my bus mate, Rithaaesh, who has been incredibly kind and supportive ever since we started travelling together. We both get down at the same stop, and every single day after our college bus drops us, he goes out of his way to drop me at my home. Even though he has no obligation to do so, he always makes sure I reach safely, and this small but consistent act means a lot to me.

Beyond just the daily travel, we share snacks, spend time together, and enjoy playing football, which has made our bond even stronger. He often invites me personally to join him at the turf, and on several occasions, he has even paid the turf fee for me without expecting anything in return. These gestures show his generosity, friendliness, and genuine care.

I truly appreciate all the moments we’ve shared—whether it’s the fun, the laughter, the games, or the simple everyday routine of going home together. His kindness and the friendship we’ve built have made my days better, and I’m sincerely grateful to have someone like Rithaaesh in my life.


I am deeply grateful to three people who helped me in meaningful ways during important moments in my life.

First, a random senior at Amrita whom I met during my certificate verification. Even though he wasn’t part of the volunteer team and didn’t know me, he guided me to the xerox office and canteen and even shared his own stationery items, making my first visit much easier.

Second, my bus mate Rithaaesh, who gets down at the same stop as me and goes out of his way every day to drop me at my home after our college bus. We share snacks, play football together, and he has personally invited me to the turf many times. On several occasions, he even paid the turf fee for me. His generosity and companionship mean a lot to me.

Third, my senior Vishali, my mother’s friend’s daughter, who helped me during my Modern Physics mid-term exam. When I urgently needed a calculator for the next day’s test, she arranged one overnight without hesitation. Her timely help truly supported me in a stressful moment.

Together, their kindness, support, and willingness to help have made a lasting impact on me, and I’m sincerely grateful to each of them.

Thank You
