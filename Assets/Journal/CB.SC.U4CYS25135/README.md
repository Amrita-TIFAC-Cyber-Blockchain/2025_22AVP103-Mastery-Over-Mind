GRATITUDE JOURNAL 
Scenario1:(23/09/2025)
I am incredibly lucky to have roommates like Amirtha, Harshitha, and Mansi, who have become my closest friends. To me, they are more than just people I share a room with; they are my support system. I realized just how special our bond is on a day when I fell really sick and felt completely helpless. I was lying in bed, feeling weak and drained of energy, and I was genuinely worried because I did not have the strength to go out and get food for myself. The thought of being alone while feeling so unwell made me very anxious.
However, I didn't have to worry for long because my roommates immediately stepped in to help. Amirtha, Harshitha, and Mansi saw that I was struggling and didn't hesitate to take care of me. They went out of their way to bring me food, making sure I ate something so I could get my strength back. When they walked in with that meal, I felt a huge wave of relief wash over me. It wasn't just about the food; it was the feeling of knowing that I was safe and that people actually cared about me. That day proved that even when I am far from my family, I am at home with them. I will always be grateful for their kindness and for making a difficult day so much easier to handle.


Scenario2:(During mid sem)
 I remember staring at my notrbooks and feeling completely lost. No matter how hard I tried to focus, the concepts just wouldn't stick in my mind. I was reading the same sentences over and over again, but nothing made sense. I felt a heavy burden because I wanted to do well, but I felt like I was falling behind everyone else. The anxiety was building up, and I started to panic, thinking that I was never going to understand the material in time for the test. I felt alone in my struggle, and my confidence was hitting rock bottom. That is when my amazing group of friends—Sreekanth, Advik, Aadidevan, Deepthi, Sathwika, Maneesha, and Midhun—stepped in to change everything.

I have always known they were good friends, but that day, they showed me what true support really looks like. When they realized I was struggling and feeling overwhelmed, they didn't just tell me to study harder; they actually sat down and studied with me. With a group this big, you might think it would be chaotic, but it was the opposite. Sreekanth and Advik were incredibly logical in how they approached the problems. When I couldn't solve a question, they didn't just give me the answer. Instead, they broke it down into tiny steps so I could see where I was going wrong.

It wasn't just about studying; it was about the environment they created. They made a safe space where it was okay for me to be wrong. They didn't make me feel dumb or slow. Instead, they celebrated every little victory when I finally got an answer right. Having Sreekanth, Advik, Aadidevan, Deepthi, Sathwika, Maneesha, and Midhun by my side turned a scary situation into a positive memory. By the end of our study session, I didn't just feel prepared for the PSAT; I felt loved and cared for. They taught me that no exam is too hard when you have the right people supporting you. I am endlessly grateful for their time, their kindness, and most of all, their endless patience.


Scenario 3:(09/08/2025)
first day at Amrita on August 9th, 2025, felt overwhelming. I was nervous and completely lost, terrified I would miss the orientation. Just when I was panicking, a kind stranger noticed my confusion and guided me to the right hall, saving me from being late. Later, things got stressful again at the canteen. The place was crowded, and when I tried to buy lunch, my online payment kept failing. I felt so embarrassed holding up the line and was about to walk away hungry.Suddenly, the same stranger paid for my meal without a second thought. then i paid that anna again then he told me a lot about the campus and made my tension go away.
