2. My Friends

Today, I just feel really thankful for my friends.They make my days brighter just by being around.Their laughter has a way of cheering me up instantly.
With them, I don’t have to pretend—I can just be myself.They listen when I need to talk and somehow always know what to say.We’ve shared so many memories that I’ll never forget.
They remind me that I’m never alone, no matter what’s happening.Even when we’re busy, they still check in and care.They get excited for me when good things happen, and that means a lot.
They’ve shown me what real loyalty and understanding look like.Sometimes we don’t even need words—we just get each other.They inspire me to be more kind, brave, and honest.
Our inside jokes never fail to make me laugh.I’m so thankful for how patient and genuine they are.Honestly, I don’t know where I’d be without them.
