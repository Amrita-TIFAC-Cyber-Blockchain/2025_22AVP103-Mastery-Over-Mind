## Journal Record
Three persons i am grateful towards in amrita university 
1.Charan(friend)
2.Sahith(friend)
3.Lokesh(senior)
 Scenario 1 :
             I'll never forget the evening of October 14, 2025. The weight of the Cybersecurity Essentials subject had been pressing down on me, and I knew I needed help before the next class. Hesitantly, I walked over to my friend Charan's room. When I explained my predicament and asked if he could possibly walk me through some of the toughest concepts, his response was immediate and without a trace of reluctance. He simply pulled up a chair and asked me where I wanted to start. What followed was an incredible, unscheduled study session that stretched late into the night. Charan’s patience was boundless. I asked him every single question I had—even the ones that felt basic or silly—and he clarified each topic with a genuine interest in my understanding, not just in rushing through the material. He used simple examples and analogies until the complicated technical jargon finally clicked in my mind. The clock had passed midnight when we finally finished, but my anxiety about the subject had vanished. Before I left his room, Charan made a promise that truly cemented my gratitude: he told me I could come to him for an explanation on any subject, anytime. Knowing I have a friend like him, always ready to lend his time and expertise, is a huge comfort. I am incredibly thankful for his selfless help that night.
Scenario 2 :
             My friendship with Sahith began shortly after the mid-semester exams, all thanks to Charan, who introduced us. From that very first meeting, Sahith quickly became an essential source of positive energy and support in my college life. He didn't just become a study partner; he became a motivator in virtually every aspect of my experience. Whether it was the competitive rush of cricket, the teamwork required in a game of volleyball, or navigating the academic challenges, Sahith's encouragement was constant. A specific instance that stands out is October 25, 2025. I was struggling with the idea of giving a class presentation—the thought of public speaking filled me with dread. Sahith patiently sat with me and taught me the fundamental techniques: how to structure my slides, maintain eye contact, and project my voice with confidence. He didn’t just review the material; he coached me on the delivery, boosting my belief in myself. Furthermore, since that day, he has made it a point to consistently explain various topics to me. His most remarkable trait is his incredible patience. No matter how many times I need a concept repeated or rephrased, he explains it clearly, showing no sign of frustration. This consistent dedication, both in academics and in personal encouragement, is why I am so deeply grateful to Sahith.
Scenario 3 :
             Today, I find myself reflecting on how fortunate I am to have a senior like Lokesh. When I first stepped onto the Amrita University campus as a first-year student, everything felt vast and a little chaotic. It was an overwhelming transition—a completely new campus, hundreds of new faces, and academic challenges that seemed much bigger than anything I had faced before. It’s easy for a new student to feel lost in that environment. However, having Lokesh as a senior resource and guide made that initial phase incredibly smooth and manageable. He didn't just offer general advice; he provided practical guidance specific to our college, helping me navigate the administrative processes and understand the unwritten rules of student life. His support was consistently there when I needed it, whether it was advice on choosing electives or tips on managing my time effectively between studies and extracurriculars. More than anything, his genuine encouragement helped me settle in faster and start believing I could succeed here. He acts like an anchor, providing stability and a sense of direction when I feel unsure. Knowing I have someone a few steps ahead who is willing to look out for me and share their experience is truly invaluable. I am tremendously grateful to Lokesh for making what could have been a difficult, overwhelming start feel like a much easier and more confident beginning.
