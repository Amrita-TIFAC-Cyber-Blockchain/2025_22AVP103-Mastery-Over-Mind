My friend: Harshitha
Time when I met her: 9-8-2025
I met Harshitha in my room when I first came to Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Coimbatore. At that time, everything was new and a
little scary for me. But Harshitha made me feel comfortable. She greeted me with a smile and made sure I felt at ease in this
new place far from home. I am very thankful to have met her because she became more than just a friend she became like family
to me.From the start, we became close friends. We spent a lot of time together, studying and helping each other with our 
classes. Cybersecurity is not an easy subject, and sometimes I felt confused and stressed. But Harshitha was always there to
support me. She patiently explained things that I did not understand and encouraged me. We would sit together in the library for hours and preparing for exams. Her dedication and support gave me strength to keep going, even when things got 
tough.Beyond studies, Harshitha is a very kind and caring person. Whenever I felt sad or worried, she listened to me without judging. Sometimes, I found it hard to share my feelings, but Harshitha always made me comfortable to talk. Her words were full of hope and comfort, and they helped me feel better. She reminded me that I am not alone and that together we can face any problem. This kindness from her means a lot to me, especially in a place where I sometimes miss my family.Harshitha is
also a very honest friend. She always tells me the truth, even if it is not easy. I know she tells me things because she wants the best for me. Her honesty teaches me to be better and to work harder for my goals in life. It is hard to find friends like her who care so much and want to see you succeed.Besides being a good student and friend, Harshitha is always ready to help others. Seeing her help others without expecting anything from anyone. She inspires me to be a better person every day.We have many memories together that I will always remember. There were nights when we studied late into the night for mid exams, supporting each other with funny jokes to reduce our stress. We also celebrating little things like finishing a assignment or getting good marks in a test and mid exams by sharing food and smiles. These moments make our friendship special and make college life happier.Harshitha’s friendship has made my time at Amrita better than I could have imagined. Having someone who understands you and stands by your side is very important when you are away from home.

SCENARIO 2 :
My roomate : Supragna
Time when I met my friend : In my first class

I am very thankful to my friend for the support and care I received from my dear friend Supragna during a critical crisis I faced while staying in the hostel. Living away from home as hostelers comes with its own challenges, and having a friend like Supragna made all the difference during one of my toughest moments. This entry is a sincere effort to share a specific incident where her kindness and support helped me immensely, and why I am deeply grateful to have her as a friend.The incident that stayed with me happened during our recent exams week—an intense period filled with long study hours, sleepless nights, and overwhelming pressure. Living in the hostel, away from family, meant that I had to manage both academic stress and personal wellbeing largely on my own. As exams approached, I began to struggle—feeling anxious and sometimes defeated. The stress started affecting my concentration and confidence. It was difficult to maintain a balance between studies and self-care.In this trying time, Supragna supports me. She noticed the change in my behavior—the quietness that I tried to hide from others. Instead of ignoring it, she reached out to me gently, offering a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on. One evening, when I was feeling completely overwhelmed by a tough subject, she invited me to join her in the common room for a short break. That small act of kindness was a turning point.She shared her own study notes, explained difficult concepts with patience, and encouraged me to take things one step at a time instead of fearing the entire workload. But Supragna’s help didn’t stop at academics. She made sure I was eating properly, reminded me to take breaks, and sent me encouraging messages when I was feeling low. In the hostel environment where we all tend to keep busy and isolated, her compassionate gestures made me feel less alone in my struggle.There was a night I remember vividly—after a particularly hard day of studying and failed attempts to prepare for an exam, I was ready to give in to despair. Supragna noticed through our messages that I was upset. Without hesitation, she came to my room with a cup of tea and sat with me. Just having her presence there calmed my anxiety. We talked about our worries, fears, and dreams. Her calm words gave me hope and the strength to keep going. That night, I realized how much her friendship meant to me.Thanks to her support, I was able to regain my focus and confidence. I approached the exams with a clearer mind and a stronger spirit. I managed to improve my performance and, more importantly, learned how to care for myself better under pressure. The incident taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, friendship, and the power of small acts of kindness.What fills me with the deepest gratitude is not just what Supragna did, but who she is—a thoughtful, caring, and dependable friend who turned a lonely, stressful time into a period of growth and hope. Her selfless help reminded me that true friendship means being present for others not only in joyful moments but also in times of crisis.As hostelers, we often miss the comfort of family and familiar surroundings. Having Supragna by my side felt like having a family away from home. Her kindness bridged the gap between loneliness and support. It lifted me above the challenges I faced and made me appreciate how much friends can impact our lives positively.This experience has inspired me to be more attentive and supportive to others, just as Supragna was for me. It has also strengthened my belief in the importance of community and empathy, especially in environments like the hostel where everyone is navigating their own battles quietly.In conclusion, I want to thank Supragna from the bottom of my heart. Her unwavering support during my crisis will always be remembered with gratitude and love.
