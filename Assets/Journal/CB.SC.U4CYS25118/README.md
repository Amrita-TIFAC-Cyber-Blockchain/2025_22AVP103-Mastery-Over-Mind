# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1 : "The loneliness loophole" 
Date : 1st day in Amrita till now
To : All the guys in my room
I am really thankful for the roomies I got. Although they may annoy me most of the time (which is all the time), I would still be their roommate for rest of the UG program. I realised their importance or their effect on my life when all of them left to their hometowns in the recent leave. I felt lonely. I always thought I was scared of nothing, literally nothing. I have all kind of stuff in my bucket list - wing walking, Bungee jumping, Leaving foot prints on to of Mt.Everest, Trip across amazon rainforest(Though it is farfetched) and even more crazy stuff. But boy, I couldn't be more wrong...I am really scared of ending up alone and being lonely. I am really thankful for all the people who gave me company, good or bad.

Scenario 2 : "The lab of 'What the hell is going on'"
Date : Every Wednesday of the past 2 Months (and probably in the future too) 
To : The lab assistant mam in the Power Electricals Lab(Her name is Priya i guess)
The only reason I know what is a IC or Transistor or even a breadboard is her. I am really thankful to her. She was the one taught me the whole 8 experiments all from scratch. Without her guidance Agarwal Sir would have chewed the pulp out of me by asking various questions the I obviously don't know the answers for. Thanks to her I was at least able to TRY the questions.

Scenario 3 : "The Housekeepers"
Date : Everyday in Kashyapa Bhavanam
To : The housekeeping staffs in the hostel and mess
I cannot express how thankful I am to them. I mentioned that my roommates annoy me 90% of the time it is because they are keeping their stuff all over the room and not keeping it neat. Since childhood I was always told to keep my surroundings neat and clean due to witch i got a little bit of OCD (or something like that). Because of my roommates I will loose my mind and step out in the corridor and boom, a wave of serenity hits me because of how neat they maintain the place. Thank you guys!

Scenario 4 : "That random 'Do you have water pa?' at Railway station"
Date : 31st October 2025
To : A complete stranger who works for the railway
My parents moved from Pollachi to Nilambur the day before. So I went to the house warming function along with my uncle. My uncle was from Coimbatore. So, on the way back I didn't have any train form Shoranur to Ettimadai for the next 3 hours but my uncle had(the train he took will not stop at Ettimadai). So, I waited at the railway station for 2 and a half hours, went out to get lunch. It was a typical railway station lunch- Ghee rice (called biriyani) along with some pickle. I was sitting in a bench eating my lunch when a random railway worker asked me whether I had water with me. Though this happened in 5 seconds of the same day I had to wait for hours and travel for even longer it literally made my day. This is when I realised that even the smallest of actions can bring happiness to someone (the thing I only read in moral stories)
