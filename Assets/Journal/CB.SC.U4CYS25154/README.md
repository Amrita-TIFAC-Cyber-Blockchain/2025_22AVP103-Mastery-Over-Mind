# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
#First Scenario#
                I am grateful to join the Amrita Viswa Vidyapeetham, a spiritual and well-disciplined institution well known for its dedicated customs and traditions. The first day, I entered the surroundings of the campus environment, which was very peaceful and heart-warming. I was totally scared on the first day of my orientation; it was totally new. New people, New environment and New instructions. Speaking the truth, I cried when my parents were about to leave.But as time goes i adjusted myself to the campus.
#Second Scenario# 
                I am grateful to have sweet roommates Bhavishya, Yasaswini and also the most coincidental thing is that Yasaswini was my classmate and college friend too. I felt assured to listen to that. And for now, everything's fine, and I wish we would continue to be like this for the whole 4 years of this campus. Bhavishya and I are good friends now. We fought with each other, but that didn't last long. we clarified our misunderstanding on that day itself, and now we are in good terms.
#Third Scenario# 
                 I am grateful to have my friends Sathwika, Maneesha, Nethra, Harshitha, Amirta, Mansi, Aadi, Midun, Advik, and Sreekanth. We had a very great time, even though it was a very short period of time. I wish this friendship of ours lasts long without any clashes in between. At the start, I was so sad to be in section B as my roommates were in section A. During that time, Sathwika and I got close to each other. I wish our friendship lasts long.I enjoyed a lot with my friends for my first outing. I wish to go to a trip with all of my friends one day.
