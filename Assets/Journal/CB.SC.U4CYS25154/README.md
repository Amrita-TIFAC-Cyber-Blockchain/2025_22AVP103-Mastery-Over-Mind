## Journal Record


#First Scenario# 
8th,August,2025
Bhavishya and Yasaswini
 I want to express my gratitude for the support I received on my first day at the campus. When I entered the college for the very first time, I was extremely nervous and tense. Everything felt new, and I didn’t know how I would adjust. The moment my parents were leaving, I couldn’t control my emotions and I started crying. It was one of the hardest moments because I suddenly felt alone and scared.But in that situation, my roommate Bhavishya was there for me. She immediately noticed how upset I was and gently consoled me. Her comforting words and calm presence made me feel safe. I am really thankful to her for understanding me without judgment. She made me feel like I wasn’t alone.Another thing that made me feel better was that my classmate and college mate were also in the same room. Being around someone familiar gave me a sense of comfort. Their presence made the room feel less like a strange place and more like a space where I belonged. I feel grateful for these people who supported me on a day when I truly needed it. Their kindness helped me settle in and feel more confident about being in this new environment.
 
#Second Scenario#
10th,August,2025
Sathwika
I want to write about something that made me feel truly thankful. When the college divided the sections, I was placed in Section B while all my roommates were in Section A. At first, I felt really sad and worried. I kept thinking that I would be left alone, and the thought of being in a new class without anyone I knew made me feel lonely and upset.But then something good happened. My roommate Sruthi introduced me to her friend Sathwika. At that moment, I didn’t know that Sathwika would become someone I could feel close to. She talked to me kindly and made me feel included. Slowly, I started feeling more comfortable being around her. Instead of feeling left out, I started feeling like I had someone I could rely on.Even though I wasn’t in the same section as my roommates, knowing that I had a friend like Sathwika made the whole situation easier. Her presence gave me confidence and made me feel like I wasn’t alone after all.I feel grateful for the way things worked out and for people who come into our lives at the right time. I’m thankful for Sruthi for introducing us and for Sathwika, who made my new section feel a little more like home.


#Third Scenario# 
11th,August,2025
Sreekanth
 I want to write about something that made me feel genuinely thankful. My lecturer gave us the task of downloading Ubuntu and Kali. Since I am from an MPC background, I had no idea how to work with these operating systems. As soon as I heard the task, I felt confused and worried because everything sounded new and technical to me.In the middle of all this, help came from someone I didn’t even really know — my classmate Sreekanth. Before this, we had never spoken much, so I wasn’t sure if he would even understand my problem. But when I asked him for help, he immediately agreed. With a lot of patience, he showed me how to download Ubuntu and Kali step by step. He did not make me feel embarrassed for not knowing something. Instead, he explained things in a simple and friendly way, which made me feel comfortable.What really touched me was that he helped me not just once, but three times. The first time, I made a mistake and accidentally moved the downloaded file to the recycle bin. The second time, I formatted my laptop, and all the files got deleted. Both mistakes were frustrating, and I felt guilty for asking again. But Sreekanth didn’t complain even once. He simply helped me again with the same patience and kindness as before.It reminded me that small acts of kindness can make a big difference. I realized that people like Sreekanth make learning easier and less stressful. I am truly grateful for his support, especially when I felt lost and unsure. His help gave me confidence and made me believe that I can learn new things, even if they look difficult at first.
