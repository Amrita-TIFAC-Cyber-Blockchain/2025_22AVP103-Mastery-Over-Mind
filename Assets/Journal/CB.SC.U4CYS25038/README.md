# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
In this Amrita university I am grateful for some people 
In those people these three are main scenarios where iam grateful.


1.  I dont know the exact date, but around 15-20 September. I met this guy named sridhar  who is from the same section which I belong to. One fine day when i  had  no bag or books with me because i didnt knew that there were further classes that afternoon. So that i came to the class without books, pen and my bag.  There were classes that day also sir asked to check notes even though he didnt know me he helped me with a book and a pen even though he didnt had a pen so that iam grateful for him.he has a very good helping nature helps me and my friends every time not only once but whener help is needed                         

2. Iam grateful for a senior in our cys department beacuse on the orientation day i had some isssues with the docuement verification and coud not sort it out it was a complex issue and was needed to go to other academic block . as im new to the college i never knew which block was where . that bro helped me not only the location of the block but he accompanie me till the block and sorted out my issue . mostly many of seniors would not be like him because that day he sorted out my issue my docuement verification was succesfully completed. and not only that time but even after that he took my number and met me an other fine day and explained about all the subjects in the department . and the do's and dont's in the campus . the behaviour with which we need to be with seniors and all the other important things . he would be reachable at any time whenver i needed help and be not as a senior but as a friend to me . it started on the orientation day.

3. Iam grateful for my roommates because at the the time when i entered the college i didnt knew a single person in the college and my birthday also was too near . I was worrying that i was gonna celebrate this birthday alone but they however knew that my birthday was on the 16th of august and celebrated it as it was their best friends birthday so that iam grateful for them .not only at my birthday they were with me all the in this campus and i never felt alone with them .        one of my roomate did one work for me for which i feel grateful where one day i needed to go to home but the train tickets has been fully booked. there is only one wy where i could go home is by booking tatkal tickets but i dont know how to book them my friend helped me get tatkal tickets to a train so that i could go home that time.
