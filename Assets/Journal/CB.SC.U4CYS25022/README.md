## Journal Record

(Srinivasan sir)Today I just wanna say how thankful I am for my Maths Sir. He’s honestly the most patient teacher ever. No matter how many times I ask him to explain the same thing, he never gets annoyed — he just smiles and explains it again until I get it.He always gives real-life examples that make maths make sense. Like, when we were learning algebra, he used examples about computer picturing. In geometry, he talked about buildings and shapes we see every day. That actually helps me understand better instead of just memorizing formulas.He’s also the kind of teacher who helps with everything — not just maths problems but also if we’re stressed or confused about collage stuff. He always says mistakes are okay and part of learning, which really motivates me.because of him, I’ve started liking maths a lot more. I’m honestly lucky to have a teacher who’s so kind, helpful, and always ready to make sure everyone understands.
