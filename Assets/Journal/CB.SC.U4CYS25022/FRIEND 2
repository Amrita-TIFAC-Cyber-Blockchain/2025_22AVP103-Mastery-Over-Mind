Today I just wanna talk about my friend who’s basically a legend at sports. He’s crazy good at cricket and pretty much every game he touches. The cool thing is, he never shows off — instead, he actually teaches me and helps me get better.
When I first tried cricket, I was honestly terrible, but he still took time to teach me how to hold the bat, swing right, and not look like a total noob. He’s always pushing me to join matches or school events, even when I don’t feel confident. Somehow he just knows how to hype me up and make me believe I can actually do it.
And when I’ve been in trouble, he’s that guy who steps in and helps me out without even thinking twice. He’s just a solid dude — fun to be around, easy to talk to, and always got my back.
Life’s honestly way better with him around. If there was a trophy for best bro, he’d totally win it every time.
