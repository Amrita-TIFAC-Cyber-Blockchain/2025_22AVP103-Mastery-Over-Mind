## Journal Record
THREE INSTANCES OF PEOPLE HELPING ME IN AMRITA:

A month ago, I found myself stuck in the staff room, caught between a cybersecurity assignment and relentless rain. I didn’t have my umbrella, and the downpour made it impossible to return to the hostel. But when I reached out to SriNavya, she didn’t hesitate. She brought me an umbrella and even took my clothes off the drying string before they got soaked.
Her thoughtfulness turned a difficult moment into something comforting. I’m truly grateful for her care and presence.

Gratitude for SriVarshini:
Weeks earlier, I was quietly struggling with my health. I hadn’t spoken about it to anyone, and I hadn’t even had breakfast. But Srivarshini, my benchmate, noticed my dizziness. Without needing an explanation, she offered to get me a cup of coffee.
That simple gesture meant the world to me. Her attentiveness and kindness reminded me that even silent struggles are seen by those who care. I’m deeply thankful to her.

Gratitude for a Stranger’s Kindness
A few days ago, I accidentally left my cash behind at the night canteen. I hadn’t even realized it when an unknown girl from another department—who had seen me ahead of her in the queue—managed to track me down and return it.
She could have easily kept it, but instead, she chose honesty and effort. Her integrity and thoughtfulness moved me deeply. I’m truly grateful to her—not just for returning the money, but for reminding me that kindness still thrives in quiet, unexpected ways.
