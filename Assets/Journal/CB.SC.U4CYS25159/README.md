## Journal Record
THREE INSTANCES OF PEOPLE HELPING ME IN AMRITA:

1. Gratitude for SriNavya
The day began ordinarily enough, the kind that seems smooth until the smallest choices spiral into stories you end up remembering vividly. It was mid-October, one of those deceptive mornings in Coimbatore when the sky looks clear and yet smells faintly of rain. I left my hostel with my assignments, laptop, and a false sense of certainty that I wouldn’t need my umbrella. I had a cybersecurity paper to finish by evening, so I planned to spend my free period in the staff room where the Wi-Fi was strong and distractions were fewer.

By noon, everything changed. The sunlight faded into a thick grey, and soon the rain began—slowly at first, then furiously, in sweeping sheets that distorted the world outside. Through the glass window, I watched the quadrangle flood within minutes. Students with umbrellas ran across the campus like colorful dots against the monochrome sky, while the rest huddled wherever they could. The staff room seemed to shrink under the sudden chill, the scent of wet earth seeping through the open vents. My phone buzzed with a weather alert—heavy rainfall warning, potential flooding in low-lying areas.

I tried to focus on the code I was debugging, but another realization struck me: my clothes were still hanging on the hostel balcony’s drying string. The rain was merciless; I could almost picture my half-dry shirts surrendering to the storm. Leaving wasn’t an option because the corridors were already ankle-deep in water. I didn’t even have my umbrella. Every solution felt out of reach, the kind of helplessness that amplifies when you’re stuck somewhere with your own thoughts.

I texted Navya impulsively. She was in the same hostel, someone I’d gotten close to through long project nights and shared late dinners at the canteen. “Hey, it’s raining bad. Clothes outside. No umbrella,” I typed, hoping for empathy but expecting just a sympathetic “oh no.” Instead, she replied, “Don’t worry. I’ll check.”

Ten minutes passed. I heard the rain hammer harder against the windowpanes. Then, a message notification blinked: “Got them! I’m coming with your umbrella :)” My heart leaped in disbelief. She was actually coming through this deluge? It sounded impossible. But fifteen minutes later, to my astonishment, I saw a faint silhouette under a maroon umbrella at the entrance of the staff wing.

It was Navya, her hair damp, her shoes soaked. She smiled like it was nothing unusual and held out my umbrella. “You should at least have this much,” she said, laughing softly. “And don’t worry about your clothes—they’re safe.”

My throat tightened a bit. It wasn’t just the relief—it was the gesture. She had navigated half the campus, through flooded walkways and pelting rain, just to save my things and make sure I wouldn’t have to wait alone helplessly. There was no hesitation in her kindness. That kind of care doesn’t shout; it moves quietly, uninterrupted by inconvenience.

As we stood there, talking about the miserable weather, the power flickered off and on again, adding a strange glow to the air. Time slowed a little. I remember thinking how simple moments like this redefine friendship—not through constant closeness, but through one thoughtful act that lingers long after the rain drains away.

Later that evening, after reaching the hostel, I found my clothes neatly folded on my bed. She had even taken the trouble to spin them dry. That gesture remained in my memory not because it was big, but because it was deeply human. Kindness, I realized, often shows up unannounced in the people who quietly look out for you when you least expect it.

That day, gratitude wasn’t just an emotion—it was a lesson in noticing small warmths amid storms, both real and metaphorical.

2. Gratitude for SriVarshini
The morning was hazy; the sky hung heavy with the stillness that comes before a headache. I had been up late revising network security protocols, and my stomach ached from too much coffee and too little food. When I walked into class, the buzzing of the projector and the murmurs of sleepy students blended into a dull hum in my head. My seatmate, Srivarshini, greeted me with her usual calm smile, but I barely managed to return it.

She noticed before anyone else did. It’s her nature—observant, quiet, yet incredibly aware. She looked at me as I sat down sluggishly and asked, “Did you eat?” I shook my head, dismissing it like it didn’t matter. But my face must have given everything away. Within minutes, the dizziness started creeping in. Words on the board danced, and my pen slipped from my fingers more than once. The world narrowed into a blur of white noise.

When the class ended, I stayed back at my desk, pretending to check something on my laptop. A moment later, she stood beside me and said, “Just wait here.” Without another word, she walked out. I didn’t question her—my energy was too low even to think.

Ten minutes later, she returned with a steaming paper cup in hand. The faint aroma told me what it was even before she said softly, “Sugar coffee. You’ll feel better.” I hesitated, but she pushed it closer. “Take it. I know what happens when you run on empty.”

I took a sip, and warmth spread instantly through my chilled body. It wasn’t just caffeine or sugar—it was the taste of being seen. The classroom was quiet, sunrays sliding through the blinds like thin gold threads. She sat beside me while I finished the cup, not talking much, not asking questions. Her silence was comforting, understanding that care doesn’t always need conversation.

Later, I found out she had skipped her own break to get that coffee from another block because the canteen nearby was still closed. That effort—so small yet so thoughtful—struck me deeply. Gratitude in that moment meant more than words could convey.

She reminded me that the truest form of kindness often hides in small pauses. The way she noticed without needing explanation, acted without demanding gratitude, and cared without dramatizing—it softened something inside me.

That single act became a turning point in how I viewed empathy. I started paying closer attention—to tone, to body language, to others’ unspoken discomfort. She showed me that even simple gestures—a cup of coffee, a word of reassurance—can alter someone’s entire day. For me, it did more than that; it turned a difficult morning into a quiet proof that someone noticed, and that was enough.

3. Gratitude for a Stranger’s Kindness
That night, campus life was alive in its usual post-study-session rhythm. The canteen buzzed with groups of students grabbing late meals—instant noodles, juice boxes, sandwiches made greasy with butter. I had queued up for a plate of dosa and tea, fumbling with my wallet while half-watching the cricket highlights on the overhead screen. By the time it was my turn, the drizzle had started outside, wind carrying the smell of wet earth through the open doorway.

After eating, I left quickly, heading for the hostel to finish some pending work. Only half an hour later, while rummaging through my backpack, did I realize that my cash pouch was missing. My pulse quickened. I had withdrawn some money that evening for lab supplies, and though it wasn’t a fortune, losing it hurt. I raced back to the canteen, heart pounding. But the queue had changed, new faces everywhere. I checked the counter—nothing.

Just as I was about to give up, someone tapped my shoulder. “Are you from the computer science batch?” I turned around to see a girl holding my pouch. She was from another department—I vaguely recognized her from the digital circuit lab corridor. “You left this near the water counter,” she said, slightly out of breath. “I saw you leaving and thought you might need it back. It took a bit to find someone who knew your name.”

I stared at her, half stunned. She could have easily kept it; there were no witnesses, no identifying mark. And yet here she was, returning something she had no obligation to. I stammered out my thanks, but she brushed it off lightly. “It happens. Just be careful next time.” Then she smiled and walked away before I could say more.

That fleeting encounter stayed with me long after. It wasn’t just the honesty—it was the willingness to go out of her way to find me. She could have chosen the simpler route of indifference. But she didn’t. And that made all the difference.

Later that night, as I resumed work, I realized something: we often underestimate how much small integrity matters. The world may seem self-centered, but occasionally, a stranger’s act shakes that cynicism. Her honesty renewed a quiet belief that goodness doesn’t always need recognition; sometimes it just wants to do the right thing quietly.

Every time I think of that evening, I remember not just the returned pouch but the expression on her face—calm, kind, effortlessly genuine. She probably forgot about it the next day, but to me, her action became a lasting reminder: kindness still survives in quiet, unexpected places.
