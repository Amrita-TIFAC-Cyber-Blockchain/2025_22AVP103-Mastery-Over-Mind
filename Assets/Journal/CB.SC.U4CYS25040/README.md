# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
1) To **Srinivasan Sir**: He has been taking Math classes for semester 1 and there couldn't have been a better way to start of such a subject. Personally, I did not find math interesting and hence could not find the motivation to study the subject as I could with the other subjects. During **August 2025**, Sir's method of teaching and enthusiasm to educate changed my perception of the subject completely. Thanks to him, I am beginning to understand why math is a beloved subject to many. Despite my poor performance in rescent mid-terms, with his guidance I am confident that I will improve exponentially.
2) To my **SIH team**: It is extremely difficult challenge to find a friend group that clicks. A friendgroup where I can fluctuate between fun and productive is something that I thought would be a long winded and time-consuming task. But, within the first month, **August 2025**, I found just that. Just a sudden request in my phone to join a hackathon team turned into what I feel will be a long lasting relationship. When needed, they can be the most committed and focused group but at the same time, I enjoy my time hanging out with them to the fullest.
3) To the **Class Advisors**: It is truly rare to be able to find faculty who are easy to talk to and approachable, and thats why I feel Section A has been extremely lucky to have **Rohini Ma'am** and **Sreejith Sir** as out class advisors. They are extremely approachable and easy to talk to. They do not make us feel trivial when we talk about our problems and they are not dismissive. They also actively ask for feedback and host counselling sessions where we can vent our problems without hesitation.
