Topic: Three people I am grateful to have met in college
  1.My friend: Sahith I am very grateful to him. I met him in the college on first day of college.He is very joyful.His encouragement helped me to adjust in the college.He helped me when I was stressed and listend to me.he explains the topics that are doudt to me with out any hesitation.he always stayed with me in difficult situations.Emotional Support and Genuine Friendship Living with him has taught me the value of emotional support. College can be overwhelming, and I’ve faced my share of tough days. Whether it’s stress from exams, homesickness, or the challenge of juggling everything, there have been times when I felt like I couldn’t handle it with the helping hand. when i scored low marks in internal exams he motivated me to read well to score good marks in mid exams.he not only helped me in studies but also in playing games. he reminded me that I am not alone and that together we can face any problem. This kindness from her means a lot to me, especially in a place where I sometimes miss my family.

He not only taught the subject but also motivated me to improve communication skills and believe in my self.His commitment to helping us understand every concept no matter how complex and no matter how many times we ask doubts truly inspires me. He is very patient and listens to our doubts regardless of how many times we ask it, this patience is what i aim to develop within myself.Emotional Support and Genuine Friendship Living with my roommates has taught me the value of emotional support. College can be overwhelming, and I’ve faced my share of tough days. Whether it’s stress from exams, homesickness, or the challenge of juggling everything, there have been times when I felt like I couldn’t handle it with the helping hand.
