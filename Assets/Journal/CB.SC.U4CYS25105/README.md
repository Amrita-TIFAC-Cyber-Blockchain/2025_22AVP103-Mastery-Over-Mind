# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

Scenario 1 (after joining campus)
<br>
After coming here, I had many self-doubts about myself, but I’m really lucky to have my roommates who are understanding, caring, and supportive even though we are separated by language. -Harshitha wakes me up every morning with a smile. She helps me a lot in my subjects and always encourages me. We enjoy listening to music in different languages and often sing together. -Whenever I feel alone or low, Nethra stands by me and lifts my mood instantly. She is a very energetic and positive girl who always brings good vibes. I share everything with her until my heart feels light, and she never fails to make me laugh again. -Mansi is the girly girl who makes me smile every single day. I truly enjoy every moment spent with her because she brings fun and liveliness to the group. She makes me feel confident and comfortable to be my true self, and her presence brightens my day. On my birthday last month, it was mid of mid-semester I was very much feeling bad for not being with my parents and them made all the things which I never expected on my birthday, I literally cried when they all surprised me. I never thought I could get this close roommate. And we all went for an outing there I was very happy that I got a good friend circle.
<br>
Scenario 2 (last week)
<br>
every one here makes fun of us Amirthas yes my frd name is also amirtha we studied in amrita vidyalayam and joined amrita college . Whenever I am depressed and want to cry aloud i talk to my friend Amirtha from other department.She is always available for me and never judge me.I sometimes wish it would be nice if she was also my department.Last week when i was very much feeling down because of some problems between my friends she was the only one whom i told everything without any first thought. She gives me attention every time and gives suggestions in my life. On her birthday me and her cse department friends gave her surprise and we all ate and danced till 1am next day. i enjoyed a lot around her. she is a bit not my type and vibe but thats the point opposite side attract. we are frds since school days every day we both talk all the gossips in class. i feel very comfortable around her. i wish she will be my roommate from next year atleast. we share a lot of stories together and still talk about our school memories and wish our friendship continous and never ends. she often feels demotivated and statrs feeling down then i will make her smile and motivate her. All her friends are also very close to me than my department friends. we travelled to home together to home in train there i was enjoying a lot with amirtha.

Scenario 3 (last week)
<br>
And one more person in my life to be gratitude is Amirtha’s Roommate lakshana. She is very calm and quite girl but have become more closer to me these days. I feel my vibe with her sometime but not all the time. We used to study till 1.30 am all nights in study room full of chats laughs musics and yes some studying also. Me amirtha and lakshana trio was a all of a sudden gang which is now my family here we care for eachother support each other always we all are available for one another I feel my bestie vibes with her. We all share snacks and buy all the food in canteen more than what we can eat and they give me to eat, basically I am a foodie I never say no to food but even though I cant eat that much food. On her birthday the cake we cut, was playfully applied on our faces but comparing her face all the cake was on my face I actually enjoyed a lot there. I feel homely around my CSE department friends. She motivates me and amirtha a lot that even when feel sleepy with her words we start studying and ironically she goes to sleep. I want her to be my friend till the end the college and even after our graduation.
