# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record


After coming here I had many self-doubts about myself, but I’m really lucky to have my roommates who are understanding, caring, and supportive even though we are separated by language.

-Harshitha wakes me up every morning with a smile. She helps me a lot in my subjects and always encourages me. We enjoy listening to music in different languages and often sing together.

-Whenever I feel alone or low, Nethra stands by me and lifts my mood instantly. She is a very energetic and positive girl who always brings good vibes. I share everything with her until my heart feels light, and she never fails to make me laugh again.

-Mansi is the girly girl who makes me smile every single day. I truly enjoy every moment spent with her because she brings fun and liveliness to the group. She makes me feel confident and comfortable to be my true self, and her presence brightens my day.
