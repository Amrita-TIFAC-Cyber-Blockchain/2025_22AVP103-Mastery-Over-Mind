Scenario 1 (after joining campus)
<br>
When I was struggling with my Physics and feeling very confused and started feeling bad, my friends Harshitha, Nethra, and Mansi helped me a lot. They sat with me and explained the physics lessons again and again until I understood everything clearly. They never got tired, and they were very patient with me. They even taught me the whole chapter twice so I would feel confident. In the test, the same topics came, and I was able to write well because of their support. I felt so happy and thankful. I am really grateful to all three of them for helping me when I needed it the most.

Scenario 2 (August month)
<br>
Everybody here makes fun of us, calling us "the Amirthas," because yes — my best friend's name is also Amirtha. It's quite a funny coincidence that both of us share not just the same name, but also a long journey together. We studied in the same school, Amrita Vidyalayam, and now by another beautiful twist of fate, both of us ended up joining Amrita College for our higher studies. I am very grateful to my friend Amirtha. During my first month here, I fell sick with a fever because of the sudden change in surroundings. I felt weak and alone, but Amirtha took care of me like a sister. She came to my room every day to check on me and make sure I was okay. She even came with me to the hospital when I needed to go. Her support made me feel safe and less scared. She cared for me just like my own family would. I will always remember her kindness, and I am truly thankful for her.

Scenario 3 (last week)
<br>
Last wednesday my laptop was not turning on. Even when it turned on, the screen was completely black. I did not know what to do because I needed my laptop for my work. I felt very worried and stressed. So I called one of my seniors Manick Chandru who is studying here. He came and checked my laptop very patiently. He tried a few things and finally fixed the problem. I felt very relieved and happy when the screen started working again. I am really grateful to him for helping me at the right time. His support meant a lot to me.
