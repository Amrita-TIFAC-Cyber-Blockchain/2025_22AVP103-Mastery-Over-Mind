# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

Scenario 1 (after joining campus)
After coming here, I had a lot of self-doubts about myself. Everything was new: the place, people, environment, and even the language. I used to overthink whether I could adjust or be able to make friends or turn out to be lonely. But as days passed, I realized how lucky I truly am to have found my roommates. They are not just people I live with; they have been my support system, my small family away from home. They are understanding, caring, and so supportive, though separated by language and from slightly different backgrounds. Somehow, despite the differences, our hearts connected so naturally that now I just cannot imagine my days without them. Each of them has a unique personality, adding color and meaning to my life.

Harshitha, for instance, is the sweetest and most disciplined among us. She wakes me up every morning with her cheerful smile and soft voice, no matter how sleepy she might be herself. That simple gesture of hers makes my mornings so much better. She never forgets to greet the day with positivity, and her energy makes me feel calm and motivated. Whenever I struggle with my subjects, Harshitha is always the first to step forward and help me patiently. She explains concepts until I completely understand them, never making me feel bad for asking too many questions. Indeed, I admire her patience and dedication. She constantly encourages me to do better and reminds me to believe in myself. Another thing that connects us is our love for music. We often listen to songs in different languages — sometimes in Tamil, sometimes in Telugu, Hindi, or even Korean. We may not know every lyric, but we enjoy the rhythm and emotion together. There are evenings when we just sit on our beds, singing along loudly, laughing at our own mispronunciations, and forgetting all our worries for a while. Those are the moments I cherish the most: simple yet so warm.

Then, there is Nethra, who is probably the most energetic and lively person I have ever come across. She has this amazing ability to sense whenever I am feeling low, even if I try to hide it. Whenever I feel alone, homesick, or just tired from everything, she somehow manages to lift my mood instantly. Her presence is like a burst of sunshine in my gloomy moments. She is always smiling, cracking jokes, and spreading positive vibes wherever she goes. Nethra has this natural charm that makes everyone around her feel comfortable. She never lets me stay sad for too long — even if I try to sulk, she’ll make sure I end up laughing within minutes. I share everything with her — from my random thoughts to my biggest worries — and she listens with so much care. Talking to her always makes my heart feel lighter. She reminds me that it’s okay to have bad days and that life is too short to take everything too seriously. Her way of cheering me up is unique — sometimes she tells funny stories, sometimes she drags me to go for a walk or dance to loud music, and sometimes she simply sits quietly beside me, letting me feel her silent support. It is comforting beyond words. She is truly one of the reasons that I have grown more confident and emotionally strong since coming here.

And then there's Mansi - the heart of our group. She's what I call the "girly girl," full of excitement, laughter, and life. She has this bright, bubbly personality that makes everyone smile without even trying. I genuinely enjoy every single moment spent with her because she makes everything fun. Whether it’s dressing up for college, taking random pictures, going for snacks, or just lying down and talking for hours, Mansi finds joy in every little thing. She’s expressive, caring, and full of warmth. She often compliments everyone, spreads positivity, and keeps reminding us to enjoy the present. I really look up to her for being herself. She doesn’t hold herself back in voicing opinions, and that confidence has helped me, too. All inhibitions are gone when she’s around; I be myself without any fear of judgment. Her presence adds a spark to our room-the kind of energy that will make even an ordinary day special. She gets me to dress up, smile more, and love myself exactly the way I am. And there's never going to be a single boring moment when she's around, and believe me, this is something for which I consider myself extremely lucky.

One of the most memorable days with my roommates was my birthday last month. It was right in the middle of our mid-semester exams, and honestly, I wasn’t expecting any celebration. I was missing my parents terribly that day. I remember sitting quietly, thinking how strange it felt to spend my birthday away from home for the first time. I was feeling low, trying to distract myself by studying, when something unexpected happened. That evening, Harshitha called me to the common area saying she needed help with something. When I walked in, I was completely shocked — the lights were dim, and suddenly they all shouted, “Happy Birthday!” The room was decorated with balloons and handmade charts. They had even arranged a small cake and some snacks. I was so overwhelmed that I couldn’t hold back my tears. I literally cried because I had never expected such love and effort from them, especially when everyone was so busy with exams. It was the purest and most touching surprise I could have asked for.

We clicked so many pictures, sang songs, danced, and laughed till midnight after cake cutting. That moment made me realize how close we had all become in such a short time. I didn’t feel homesick anymore because my roommates made me feel like I was right at home — just in a different version of it. The next weekend, we decided to go for a small outing to celebrate properly after our exams. It was one of the best days ever. We went to a nearby park and then to a café, took tons of pictures, shared food, and talked endlessly. I felt so happy and thankful that day because I knew I found the right people to share my journey with. I looked around at them laughing and teasing with each other, and I thought — this is my little family now. These experiences have taught me so much about friendship, care, and emotional connection. Before coming here, I thought making genuine friends in a new place would be difficult. But Harshitha, Nethra, and Mansi proved me wrong. They showed me that friendship doesn’t depend on how long you’ve known someone or whether you speak the same language fluently. It depends on understanding, effort, and genuine love. We may come from different regions and have different habits, but our bond goes beyond all that. We share everything — our joys, our frustrations, our secrets, our silly jokes, and even our food. Living with them has taught me patience, empathy, and how to enjoy the little moments in life. Now, when I look back, I feel proud of how far I’ve come — from being a shy, doubtful person to someone who feels confident, loved, and at home. My roommates have played a huge part in that transformation. They made me believe in myself again. Every night when we sit together chatting or laughing before bed, I silently thank life for giving me such amazing people. We started as strangers who barely understood each other’s language, but now we’re like sisters who share a bond which no words can describe. I’ll always be grateful for them because they turned what could have been a lonely experience into one filled with laughter, comfort, and unforgettable memories.
