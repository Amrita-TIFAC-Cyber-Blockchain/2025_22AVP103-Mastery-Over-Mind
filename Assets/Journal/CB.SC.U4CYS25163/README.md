# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
## Journal Record
GRATITUDE JOURNAL
1.SCENARIO-1
  AUGUST 2025 to Present
Person: My Roommate and Good Friend (Gagana)
When I think about people I am truly thankful for, the first person that comes to my mind is Gagana, my roommate. I met her last year in august 2025, when I started living in the hostel for college. 
From the very first day, Gagana has been very kind and friendly to me. I still remember how she helped me with arranging my things that first evening, when I was feeling lost. One thing I am most thankful for is how much Gagana helps me with my studies. I always find some subjects tough, especially physics and maths. Whenever I get stuck with doubts, she is always ready to explain things, no matter how many times I ask. She patiently teaches me and gives examples, and she never gets angry if I take time to understand. Before exams, we stay up late revising together—she keeps me focused when I get distracted and even encourages me not to give up. 
There was one time in October 2025, just before the mid-term exams, when I was really stressed. That’s when Gagana sat with me and explained everything step by step. She made sure I understood. After that, I felt good for the exam. That night I realized how lucky I am to have her as my friend.
But she hasn’t just helped me with studies. I remember i got severe ear pain in september 2025. I was too feeling low to get out of bed. Gagana took care ofme. brought me medicine, and made sure I took medicine and rested. She even helped me talk to the teacher about my assignment deadline.
Every day, Gagana does small things that really matter. If I need something from the store, she brings it when she goes out. If I am feeling low, she listens to me and cheers me up with her jokes or just by spending time with me. She never makes me feel like I am troubling her.
One of my favorite memories is from my birthday in october 2025. I was feeling sad because I missed home. But Gagana surprised me  getting a small cake. We both laughed, danced, and clicked funny pictures. Because of her, my special day became truly special, and I didn’t miss home that much.
. Sometimes we fight over silly things, like who should clean the room or whose turn it is to switch off the light at night. There are so many small ways in which she help. She helps me arrange my timetable, reminds me about important college events
When I look back, I understand the real meaning of gratitude. To me, gratitude is feeling thankful for people like Gagana, who bring smiles, help, and support in difficult times. I hope to always be a good friend to her as she has been to me.
So, my gratitude journal starts with Gagana , my friend and roommate.



2.SCENARIO-2
 November 5th 2025
Person: Kind Old Uncle (Shop Customer Near the Store)

I want to write about something that happened in november 2025, which made me feel very thankful. It was one normal evening after our classes. Me and my friend needed to buy a few things for our hostel room some snacks—so we decided to walk to a store that was a bit far from our hostel. 
  When we started picking things we needed, we realised we didn’t bring any cash; we only had money in our PhonePe app for UPI payment. It was a small shop and we saw that the shopkeeper didn’t have any way to accept UPI, only cash.
We checked all our pockets and bags to see if we could find just enough money, but we didn’t have any cash at all. If we wanted to get the things we needed, we had to go all the way back to our hostel, pick up money, and then come again. The hostel is so far from the shop .
While we were standing and getting worried, a kind old uncle who was nearby noticed our problem. He was another customer in the shop and looked very simple and friendly. He walked up to us and asked, Is everything okay? We explained what happened, and he immediately said, Don’t worry, children I can help. He opened his wallet and gave us enough money to buy all our things.
We felt so surprised and thankful at that moment. Uncle was a total stranger, but he trusted us and helped us without expecting anything in return. He even smiled and said, It happens sometimes. Because of his help, we were able to buy everything without wasting time and without having to go all the way back to hostel. returned the money with many thanks. We told him how much it meant to us, and he just smiled and said, You don’t need to thank me so much. 

3.SCENARIO-3
  August 2025 to Present
Person: My Cyber Essentials Lecturer (Mr. Saurabh Sir)

I want to write about someone who has really helped me in my studies this year—my Cyber Essentials lecturer, Mr.Saurabh sir. He started teaching us in August 2025, when our new semester began. Honestly, before this, I was a little scared of computer and cyber topics because they always seemed very tough. But ever since I started attending his classes, I feel a big difference in how I look at these subjects.
The best thing about Mr.Saurabh sir  is that he teaches in a very clear and simple way. He does not use difficult words and never tries to show off. When he explains something, he gives us real-life examples, which makes it much easier for me and my friends to understand every topic. For example, when he taught us about passwords and online safety. 
Sometimes, if someone in the class doesn’t understand the concept, he happily repeats it again. He does not get impatient or angry. Instead, he explains in a different way until we all are clear. Because of his teaching style, even students who usually find computer subjects hard are now able to follow along. I remember the topic Subnet topic was very confusing for me. I couldn’t get it at first, but he patiently explained it using a simple story. After that, I understood it perfectly.
Whenever I leave his class, I always feel like I have actually learned something new and useful for my life. 
If we have doubts after class, he never says he is too busy. He is always ready to talk, either in the classroom or even if we meet him outside. He asks if we are understanding the lessons and gives extra notes when someone requests.
Thanks to him, my interest in the subject has grown a lot.
I feel lucky to be in his class this semester and I am very grateful for all his efforts.
