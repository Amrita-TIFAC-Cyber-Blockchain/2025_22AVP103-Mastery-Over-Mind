Topic: I am grateful for three persons in my college

Today, I want to express my gratitude to three wonderful people in my college who have made a positive difference in my life — my best friend, my class advisor, and my lab mate

Firstly, I am grateful to my best friend RAHUL, who has always been by my side through every situation. Whether it is preparing for exams, participating in events, or Elase i am in stress, this friend has encouraged me and made college life more enjoyable. Their constant support and cheerful attitude remind me that good friends make every journey easier.

Secondly, I feel thankful to my class mentor Sreejith Sir, who always motivates everyone in the class to do their best. Whenever I struggle with academics, my advisor patiently listens and provides guidance. Their words have often inspired me to stay focused and believe in my abilities.

Lastly, I am grateful to my lab Mate Jashwanth, who helped me understand difficult concepts with great patience. He never hesitate to explain things again and ensure that i understand the concept, learns with confidence. His dedication has increased my interest in the subject and improved my practical skills.

I truly feel blessed to have such caring and supportive people in my college life. They have not only helped me grow academically but also taught me the value of kindness, encouragement, and teamwork.

Being grateful for these three individuals reminds me that success in college is not just about grades, but about the people who guide, support, and walk with us along the way.
