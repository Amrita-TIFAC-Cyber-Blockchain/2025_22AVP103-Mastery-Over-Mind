## Journal Record

I am grateful for many peoples, here i will share 3 of them. first when i came to this campus i was very tensed about everything, my parents was also very tensed, there was lot in my mind like, am i able to study engineering, will i get good friends, will teachers be friendly? etc..., then i met my roommate called aadidevan he is also a malayali like me, he was also little bit tensed like me, after we saw each other we both felt some relief in mind, we talked a lot, from there till now he is a very good friend to me, he will help me in studies, always will give company everywhere even though he is from different section but same room. the next person is from amrita central library his name was Ranjith, he also helped me and my parents when we was here for the first time, like he was the one who told the admission procedures for this college, like write entrance exam, prepare well, score good marks in both boards anf jee if possible etc.. he also motivated me to study hard. without him i not able to reach here. the third one is our Ramaguru sir, who was our MAOM teacher and my hackathon mentor, eventhough he is full busy with his works, he helped us with our hackthon project and even we won in internal hackathon, and also his classes are very good because it will be very intractive we can easily connect to whatever he says. so these are the three people who i am grateful for.
