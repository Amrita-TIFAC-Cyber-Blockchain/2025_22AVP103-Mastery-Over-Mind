I am most grateful to Amma, all my faculties and friends. To break down to one teacher and one friend, I feel I am grateful to Mr. Ramaguru sir and Pranay our class rep.

I am greatful to Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi Devi) who is the reason we all are having this wonderful opportunity! 
the chance to study here—in an environment that successfully incorporates both good academics with deep-rooted values—is a profound gift. My gratitude towards Amma and the opportunity to study here is immense! 

I am grateful to Mr. Ramaguru sir and all my other faculties too.The MAOM course is a cornerstone of the Amrita curriculum, and his instruction are pivotal.He has provided us with wisdom and the ability to think clearly and manage our emotions given the amount of educational pressure we go through , his guidance in doing meditation helps alot! He guides us on how to manage the human mind—making the journey through my degree not just bearable, but truly insightful.

I am greatful to my friend Pranay who is also our class representative, we first started to get along during the SIH preparations, since then he has always been a very good friend! A representative requires a special blend of selfless leadership and exceptional communication, and he excels at both. Not only him but I am greatful to all my friends who has always been on my side whenever I needed them and also helped me get along!
