I am gratefull to my classmates Adhi and Ashwin who helped me during a day I took leave, by keeping record of all that happened in class during that day and on the next day when I came, they took the effort and time to inform all that has happened and even helped me understand all the concepts that was thought to me

I am grateful to every one of my teachers here at Amritha, but even so I am more grateful to Cibi sir who accepted our request to be the advisor for our hackathon team. As a teacher he made some time on his busy schedule to assist us with our project and suggested various tips and corrections, without we would have been clueless as a first year taking part part in our first hackathon, so I am incredibly grateful that Cibi sir was there for us
