# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind



## Journal Record

	

 
  I want to show my gratitude to my CYS teacher, Saurabh sir. The reason is that I was first nervous entering class as I chose CYS as my interest, denying my parents' wish. Still, after I attended CYS classes, I am now confident I will be strong at basics and can withstand and overcome all difficulties in this subject because I feel I am good at the basics of CYS, which is going to make my B-tech journey strong and confident. Thank you, sir, for making me confident.


I would like to show my gratitude to the hostel cleaners because some of the students in the hostel don't maintain cleanliness and just  make the hostel look unclean. They, without hesitation, clean the hostel, so I would like to thank them for their support. When some of my friends celebrate Birthday parties, they make the corridor dirty, but the staff of that hostel make it look neat.


I would like to show my gratitude to my Class advisor, Praveen sir. We students of the CYS B section faced a lot of problems after the Mid-semester exams. And Sir also motivated us for the further exams and taught us how to handle ourselves when we get lower marks in exams. I am very thankful to Sir for guiding us and supporting us.
