## Journal Record
My Gratitude journal:
I am grateful to Srinivasan Sir, who understands his students and allows me to rest in class when I feel sleepy. I am also thankful to the cleaning staff of our college for maintaining a clean and homely environment for all of us. finally, I truly appreciate my Class Advisor, Sreejith Sir, for guiding our class, addressing our concerns, and helping us solve our problems with patience and care.
