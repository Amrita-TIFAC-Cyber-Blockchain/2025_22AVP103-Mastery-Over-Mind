## Journal Record
good evening iam pranav from the cybersecurity branch of section A held by the roll number CB.SC.U4CYS25008 
after joining here from the frist day iam greatful for some people from our clg who have helped me from things

1. My friend pranay who has been a good company from the day I have met and there is one when iam feeling alone and low he saw me realised and gave me a feeling of comfort that iam not alone and he did spent some time with me.

2. Our HOD sir Mr.Sethumadhavan sir who has resolved the problem of transportation from our classes to the mess at the lunch time inspite his busy schedule he gave preference to us and resolved the issue by the next day

3. Our senior pushpak who had shown me the whole college and there is one day in specific that he called me on his own and shown me the way to the gym and gave a routine to follow .

meeting this three people in my intermediate level is more meaningful and fulfilling. they have contributedmin improve and getting a great attitude from myself
