## Journal Record
good evening iam pranav from the cybersecurity branch of section A held by the roll number CB.SC.U4CYS25008 
after joining here from the frist day iam greatful for some people from our clg who have helped me from things
1 .From the first day I met Pranay, he struck me as the kind of person who turned even the most mundane moments into something memorable. It was during our freshman orientation at college-a chaotic whirlwind of new faces, unfamiliar buildings, and that underlying anxiety of starting over in a place far from home. I remember standing stiffly in the hostel courtyard, clutching my backpack like a lifeline, when Pranay strode up with a wide grin and introduced himself. "Hey, I'm Pranay-from Hyderabad. You look like you could use a tour guide," he said, his voice warm and devoid of the pretentiousness that so many others carried. We clicked instantly over shared complaints about the spicy canteen food and our mutual love for late-night cricket matches on TV. Little did I know then that this chance encounter would blossom into a friendship that would be my anchor in the stormy seas of college life.

Pranay wasn't just good company; he was the kind of guy who could make you feel seen without him even trying. We would spend hours in the common room, debating over everything from philosophy classes to which street vendors served the best food in town. He'd crack jokes that would leave everyone in stitches, his laughter infectious and genuine. What separated him from others, though, was his quiet intuition-the way he knew the room, or more importantly, people. There were days when the pressure of assignments, exams, and the loneliness of living away from family got to me. I'd retreat into my room, scrolling mindlessly through my phone, with the world closing in on me. Pranay never intruded uninvited, but he always knew when to show up.

But it was a rainy evening in our second semester that really sealed our friendship. I had just received a disappointing grade on a project I'd poured my heart into. The rejection stung deeper than I admitted, stirring up old insecurities about not belonging in this competitive environment. I skipped dinner and sat alone on the hostel steps, watching the downpour blur the lights of the campus. The loneliness hit like a wave—I felt invisible, adrift in a sea of ambitious strangers. That's when Pranay appeared, umbrella in hand, his sneakers splashing through puddles. He didn't ask what was wrong at first; he just sat down beside me, offering a packet of biscuits from his pocket. "Rough day?" he finally said, his tone light but his eyes searching mine. I opened up then, spilling out my frustrations—the fear of failure, the homesickness that crept in at night. Pranay listened without interrupting, nodding occasionally, his presence a steady counter to my turmoil. When I finished, he didn't bombard me with advice or platitudes. Instead, he shared a story from his own life: how he'd once bombed an entrance exam and felt like giving up, only to realize that setbacks were just detours. "You're not alone in this, man," he said simply. "We've got each other's backs." To drive the point home, he insisted we go for a walk despite the rain, dragging me to the nearby chai stall where we sat under a leaky awning, sipping hot tea and watching the storm pass. That night, he spent more than an hour with me, turning what could have been a spiral into a moment of reconnection. We talked about everything and nothing: future dreams, favorite movies, even silly what-if scenarios. By the time we headed back, the weight on my chest had lifted. Pranay's comfort wasn't dramatic; it was subtle, rooted in his unwavering reliability. He made me feel not just supported, but truly understood, as if my struggles were valid and shared. He has been there through countlessly more lows and highs over the years. Whether it's pulling all-nighters for group projects or celebrating small victories with impromptu outings, his friendship has taught me a thing or two about empathy in action. In a world that oftentimes feels isolating, especially in the high-stakes bubble of college, Pranay reminds me that true company isn't about constant presence-it's about showing up when it matters most. Of course, that rainy evening wasn't the only time he sensed my loneliness and stepped in; it's become a pattern, a testament to his character. He's the friend who turns solitude into solidarity, and for that, I'll always be grateful. A bond forged within those early days and strengthened through shared vulnerabilities, a reminder that sometimes the best company comes from someone who simply refuses to let you feel alone.


2. Few people stand out as steadfast pillars of support in the busy ecosystem of our college, where lectures, labs, and deadlines set the rhythm for every day, besides our Head of Department, Mr. Sethumadhavan Sir. I first met him during my induction program, when he was giving a welcome address both inspiring and pragmatic. Wearing neatly pressed shirts, wire-rimmed glasses, and a commanding voice without ever raising the volume, he outlined the vision of the department in the light of innovation and excellence. It was what he did off the podium, however, that spoke volumes about his commitment to students. From an unquestionably busy schedule, overseeing faculty meetings, research grants, and administrative hurdles, he managed to always give priority to the pragmatic needs of those under his care.
It was a chronic issue regarding transportation from our classrooms to the mess for lunch that brought all these contrasting characteristics of his into sharp focus. Our campus sprawled over acres of greenery and modern buildings, proving to be a double-edged sword-beautiful on one hand, yet logistically challenging on the other. The engineering block, where most of our classes were held, was a good 15-minute walk away from the central mess hall. In this scorching midday heat or during the sudden monsoons, the trek was nothing short of torture. Students would rush out of lectures, stomachs growling, only to arrive late, sweaty, and frustrated, finding lines already snaking out of the doors. Complaints had been doing the rounds for months-whispers in hostels, formal emails to the student council-but nothing came out of it. The college shuttles were reserved for inter-campus travel, and no one seemed to have the authority or will to address this daily inconvenience.

That's when a few of us, driven by collective frustration, decided to approach Mr. Sethumadhavan Sir personally. It was the busy middle of a week; mid-semester exams were near, and there were whispers about his involvement with a major conference. We hung outside his office, debating whether to bother him. But he caught sight of us through the glass door and waved us in with a smile. "Come, come-what's on your minds?" he said, removing a pile of papers from his desk. We told him the whole problem: time lost, afternoon classes' attendance affected, health issues when the weather was extreme. I remember stammering through my part, expecting a polite dismissal or a promise to "look into it."

Much to our surprise, Sir listened intently, jotting notes on a notepad. He asked incisive questions-how many students were affected; were there peak hours; what alternatives had we considered? His busy schedule was apparent: his phone buzzed incessantly, and a colleague knocked twice with urgent queries. Yet, he gave us his full attention, treating our concern as if it was important rather than trivial. "This affects your focus and well-being," he said. "We'll fix it." No great speeches-just plain acknowledgment that student welfare was important.

True to his assurance, the resolution was rapid. The very next day, an email went around from the department: a dedicated shuttle service would ply every 10 minutes between 12:45 PM and 1:30 PM, transporting the students directly from the engineering block to the mess. Sir had coordinated with the transport office to reassign resources from underutilized routes. When we boarded the first shuttle that afternoon, the air was abuzz with relief and gratitude. The ride was smooth, air-conditioned, and cut the journey to under five minutes. Lunch lines moved quicker, classes began as scheduled, and spirits on campus lifted.

Mr. Sethumadhavan's intervention wasn't just about logistics; it was a lesson in empathetic leadership. In a role burdened with bureaucracy, he chose to take an immediate decision that even small issues deserve attention if they affect large numbers. I have watched him continue this level of dedication while extending lab hours into exam season, mediating conflicts fairly, or mentoring students on career paths. His example has made me appreciate proactive problem-solving in my own life. In an institution where hierarchy can feel unreachable, Sir closes that gap by showing us that true authority is exercised through service: that swift resolution to our transportation woe was not one-off but emblematic of a HOD who, despite his demands, always puts students first

3.Entering college life as a freshman is overwhelming and feels like being dropped into an unknown city without a map. That is where the seniors, like Pushpak, become beacons of experience, lighting the way. Since the time I came to campus, Pushpak stood out to me as approachable and knowledgeable. He was a third-year mechanical engineering student, tall with an easy smile, and he knew just what to say to others. Our very first interaction was during a campus tour organized by the student welfare committee. While other seniors droned out facts mechanically, Pushpak made it engaging. He pointed out the hidden treasures: the best spot for stargazing on the rooftop, the secret quiet corner of the library for naps, and the use of shortcuts to shave minutes off daily commutes. "College isn't just classes," he told our group. "It's about discovering what makes this place yours." His enthusiasm was contagious, and by the end of the tour, I no longer felt like an outsider but a part of something bigger. Pushpak didn't just show us the physical layout; he shared insights that eased the transition. He warned about the toughest professors, recommended study groups, and even tipped us off to the mess's rotating menu specials. But his guidance went beyond the obligatory-he took an interest in freshmen, remembered names, and followed up. For me, that personal touch made all the difference in those early, disorienting weeks. The day that really made Pushpak's mentorship stand out was the middle of my first month. I had mentioned casually during the tour that I wanted to get into fitness, but I didn't have the vaguest idea where to begin with it. The gyms at college intimidated me: crowded with people who were great at it, filled with equipment I had never seen before. I knew I would get to that eventually, but the motivation waned amidst settling-in chaos. Then, out of the blue, my phone buzzed with a call from Pushpak. "Hey, it's your senior from the tour. You free this evening? Let's hit the gym-I remember you said you were interested." I was shocked; he had called on his own initiative, without any prompting from me. We met at the campus sports complex, when the sun had dipped low and cast a golden hue over the fields. Pushpak led the way, chatting casually about his own fitness journey—how he started as a skinny freshman and built consistency through trial and error. The gym was quieter in the evening, less daunting. He began with a full walkthrough: the cardio machines, weight racks, free weights, and functional training areas. "Start slow," he advised, demonstrating proper form on basics like squats and bench presses to prevent injuries. He explained the science behind it—how compound movements build strength efficiently, the importance of warm-ups and cool-downs. But Pushpak didn't stop at the tour. Sensing my novice status, he crafted a customized routine on the spot, scribbling it on his phone's notes app. It was a beginner-friendly one: three days a week, full-body workouts. Day 1: Squats 3x10, push-ups 3x12, dumbbell rows 3x10, and then planks. Day 2: Deadlifts, overhead press, pull-ups, core work. Day 3: A mix with cardio intervals. He included progressions-how to increase weights gradually, track reps in a journal, and incorporate rest days. "Nutrition matters too," he said, hinting at simple meals like oats for breakfast and protein-rich dinners from the mess. He shared his playlist to motivate me and also advised me about common pitfalls, like overtraining. That session lasted nearly two hours, with Pushpak spotting me, correcting my posture, and encouraging every rep. "You've got this—consistency over intensity at first," he said. By the end, I wasn't just informed; I was inspired. Following his routine transformed my habits--I gained confidence, energy, and even made gym friends. Pushpak's initiative that day was the perfect example of senior mentorship. He didn't wait for me to ask; he proactively bridged the gap, turning a vague interest into actionable steps. All other areas of guidance—career advice, club recommendations—paled in comparison, though. The gym routine was a tangible gift, one that made a difference in my well-being. In college, where independence is thrust upon you, mentors like Pushpak provide the scaffolding to build it right. His selflessness has inspired me to pay it forward, reminding me true leadership is empowering others to find their way.
