# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
I’m really thankfull to my warden that day when I forgot to apply outpass before 24 hours. I totally forgot only till morning and I started panicing bcoz I really need to go out. I went to her office hoping she will understand but when I said what happend she got angry little bit. She scolded and told “you know the rule ah! you should apply yesterday only, now I cant give.” I felt really bad and just standed there quiet, didn’t know what to say. I know it was my mistake so I dint argue anything. After some mins she looked again and asked why u want to go out. I told everything truly and she just sighed and said “ok but next time dont do like this again.” then she gave me the outpass finally.I was so happy and relaxed that time. Even she scolded I know she dint mean bad, she only want us to follow rule properly. Still she helped me after that so it showed her soft side also. I realise that day rules are important but being honest and saying truth also matters lot. After that I never forget to apply the outpass again. I really respect her for being strict but also understanding when we do small mistakes.

I’m really grateful to Srinivasan sir bcoz he teaches so good and makes us understand everything so easily that even if we know nothing we can still get it. He never scolds when we answer something wrong, instead he just corrects us and explains again in a more easy way so we don’t forget. Even if we miss one of his class, in the next one he gives small recap in such a way that we understand properly. He even teaches the toughest topics like they are nothing, and everyone can follow along without getting bored.Before, I was really bad in maths and used to get scared when I see big formulas. I always thought I can never understand it no matter how much I try. But after attending Srinivasan sir’s class for few weeks, things started to make sense slowly. He explains step by step so clearly that I don’t get lost like before. Now I actually like solving sums and I feel so happy when I get the correct answer. He never makes us feel bad if we don’t know something, instead he just smiles and says everyone learns in their own speed. Bcoz of that, our class feels chill and stress free. No one is scared to ask doubts anymore, and even the people who hated maths before started liking it. I also feel more confident now.

I’m really thankfull to my senior who helped me that day when I was going from my college to Hosur during Onam holidays. It was my first time going home after joining college and I was so excited but also little scared. I never travelled this long alone before. Plan was to leave after class only but I dint knew properly how to find correct bus. Whole college people was going to bus stand or Coimbatore junction, I went by train first and then from there I took auto to Gandhipuram.When I reached Coimbatore bus stand it was full crowded bcoz of holidays. I was walking here and there trying to find bus to Hosur but there were too many platforms and I got fully confused. I started panicking thinking I will miss my bus. That time one senior from my hostel saw me and came near asking “you going home for Onam ah?” I said yes and told her I couldn’t find the bus. She immediately said “don’t worry I’ll help you, I travelled that side many times.” She helped me find the correct bus, asked the conductor and even helped to keep my luggage properly.After getting inside she told me where to sit so it will be comfortable since it was long journey. In bus she talked nicely about hostel life, college fests and how to adjust in first sem. I felt relaxed after that and all my fear just gone. I’m really greatfull to her for helping me that day, if she was not there I would have been totally lost in that big crowd.
