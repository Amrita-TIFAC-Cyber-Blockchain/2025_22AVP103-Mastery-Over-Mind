Gratitude Journal

First, I Like to thank my teachers. During the midterm exams,even though I went for doubt clarification at the last minute, they helped me.Also, 
they helped issues regarding aums at the right time during FIH midterm examination, we helped many to write their exams.

Second, I like to thank the warden in the mess. Although they are not allowed to give extras, at the end when we requested fruits on that day which was excess,
he allowed us to take as many I want.

Third, I like to thank my friend Sai, who tutored me for the math exam which I was not completely not prepared.
Due to his tutoring, I was able to perform well in that particular exam


Lastly, For providing this opportunity to express my gratitude, I want to thank Ramaguru Sir,
Helping me to feel thankful to everything I get in my life but other persons
