I thank my hostel cleaner who keeps our hostel comfortable and clean everyday, me along with my friends are very grateful to your sincere services. When we had my friend's birthday we left the corridor very tidy but you cleaned everything and made it spotless. Your hard work made our hostel feel better and more organized.

I thank Mr. Karthik Sharma sir for 600 mins of his faithful and patient teaching.
