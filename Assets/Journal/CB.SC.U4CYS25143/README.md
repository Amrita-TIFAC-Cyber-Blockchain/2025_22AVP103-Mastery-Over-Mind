# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

Gratitude journal:

Date:​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ October 18, 2025 (Night) Time: Approximately 10:05 PM Location: Coimbatore Junction (CBE), By the Platforms

In this way of life at the very platform of a busy and difficult place, I would like to pass my thanks to the world through a total stranger. Tonight at the Coimbatore Junction, I was momentarily saved from making a massive, gloomy mistake and a closely watching person happened to deliver me from a terrible situation.
I was on the way to my home, or at least going home, by the Nilgiri Superfast Express (12672), which is always scheduled to leave Coimbatore around 10:25 PM and reach Chennai by 6.35. I saw the train coming, and with the confusion of the sign and my late-night tiredness, I convinced myself that it was my train. I was preparing myself in my mind to take the train that was actually the Alappuzha-MGR Chennai Central Superfast Express (22640), which had left Coimbatore a little earlier around 9:35 PM .It turned out to be a problem for both trains listed on the board because they were headed to Chennai. They went in that direction for a good number of kilometers, but they were not the same train. I had even gone so far as to think it was my coach, I loaded my heavy bag on to the platform with a grunt and I was ready to lift myself into the coach, mentally checking out for the night.That’s when you spoke.Not really. You were not physically equipped with a uniform or a badge that can give you the authority to intervene in a situation like ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌mine.


The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Unexpected Teacher,

It was 9:00 PM on the night of November 12th. This particular moment, which was quite normal at that time, is now the event that I can trace the origin of my friendship with you - the unexpected one. Your amazing gesture of generosity and patience is the reason.We, you and I, were not friends from the very beginning. Our friendship was just a happy accident you shared a room in a hostel with my classmate. I am a person who usually tries to figure out things on my own and is often stubborn, but this particular assignment was a challenge too high for me to climb. It was a coding task, deeply entrenched in Python, and I was completely lost.I vividly remember entering your room with my heart racing. The feeling that goes with this is a mixture of anxiety and embarrassment. To ask for help in programming, a technical area, is like giving up. I might have been quite incoherent when I told you about the problem I had with the assignment, and I was bracing myself for the very short and quick guidance that a student who is in a hurry most likely would give.However, you, Pragateeshwar, chose to do something totally different.The Gift of Unhurried TimeYou didn't just hand me the solution, but you also brought me your time.After postponing your own assignment, you came over, and rather than jumping to the solution, you got me to explain the problem from the very beginning. From 9:00 PM onwards, for what felt like forever (but was exactly one hour and thirty minutes), you were fully committed to my confusion.That time of an hour and a half was not just about mending a few lines of code; it was a great lesson in real mentorship. For you, it was not a chore to finish my assignment, rather it was a challenge that we would conquer together.When I didn’t understand the concept of loops for the third time, you didn’t react negatively or check the time. Instead, you sketched a diagram, gave an example of stairs, and explained the basic principle again until the "Aha!" moment finally came in my head.We did exactly what was necessary for me—no more, no less. You instructed me on list comprehensions, the correct way of writing a function, and how to debug error messages without becoming nervous. It was not about a quick solution; it was about setting a foundation so that I would not have to seek the same assistance next week.You were really nice: There was no judgment in your voice. No feeling of being intellectually superior. Merely a calm, focused, and friendly eagerness to see me succeed. It was that kindness which converted a simple transaction  into a relation.What most struck me during those 1.5 hours was that you were completely indifferent to time. In the hectic life of a student where every minute is accounted for studying, eating, or catching up on sleep, to give up 90 minutes of your valuable evening is a great sacrifice. You didn’t worry about missing a meal or delaying your work. Your only concern was that I learned the Python concepts I needed.Beyond the CodeThe task is long done, handed in, and probably forgotten by my professor. But the lesson I took that night has remained with me: the real worth of human interaction and giving without expecting anything in return.Your assistance that day went beyond school work. It made me understand the concept that if you want help, first you have to help others, the indomitable patience it takes to be with a struggling person and, the mere fact that some of the best friendships originate from the most unanticipated situations—like a flickering laptop screen and vexing lines of code.Thanks a lot, Pragateeshwar. Thanks for the Python knowledge. Thanks for the 90 minutes of your time. But above all, thank you for being the friend who not only teaches the subject but also the delight of learning. That night of November 12th was an unforeseen blessing, and I am lucky to have you as a friend.I treasure your attitude being unselfish and showing the patience on November 12th at 9:00 PM.
It will remind me to Share my knowledge and time with others just like you ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌did.


My Bro Sabari,

It’s quite strange how some moments have the power to stick with you as if they happened yesterday, even though a long time has passed. The memory of almost two years ago and that cold November day during our botany class, is the one that keeps coming back to my mind and it is also one of the reasons why I like having you as my friend.
I keep thanking you over and over, but those quick "thank yous" we throw at each other don't really convey what I feel, especially now when I reminisce. I really should thank you in a more proper way. You are the ultimate friend that any person could wish for and therefore, I am writing this journal entry to recognize your fabulous and long-lasting loyalty.That was impromptu quiz when Ms. Nivas was throwing questions at the students randomly and she called on me. She brought the most difficult question to me about plant respiration if I am not mistaken, she asked the difference between aerobic and anaerobic processes in roots—and I didn’t come up with an answer. I was so nervous, the room was so silent—I couldn’t move. I can even recall the feeling of embarrassment that came over me.That's when you came to my rescue. I saw your eye going towards the board and, before I could even respond, you silently but clearly mouthed the answer for me. You were the one who was going to save me from the fiasco of failing and getting embarrassed in front of everyone.The unfortunate and also the main point of this memory is that you were the one who really had the answer. Even then, you had a deep almost instinctive understanding of botany. You were the one who knew all the cellular pathways, the chemical equations, the entire cycles.inside out. However, for some reason, the examination system did not always fully support you, and I was frequently the one who got the higher score, although I knew less. Your knowledge was always better, but your grades did not reflect that.Besides that, due to your brave whisper because you used your superior knowledge to help me with mine—Ms. Nivas decided to single you out. When I heard her calling your name and giving you the punishment, the feeling in my stomach turned upside down. It was my failure, my moment of unpreparedness and yet, you got the punishment for me.The feeling of watching you take that punishment instead of me will always be stored in my memory. It was a very concrete and powerful illustration of the essence of real friendship. You had the option of giving up your free time, your clean record, and going through that detention, solely for the purpose of rescuing me from a very short and unpleasant moment in the classroom. That level of protective loyalty cannot be purchased or time-stamped.From that point of view, I can tell what kind of a man you are. You never talked about it later, you never leveraged it against me. You only went as far as it was needed for our friendship. Even up to now, that gesture makes me feel like I owe you a great deal. It was not about the answer; it was about the thought. You never failed to put my needs before your own comfort.I wish you could know that at this moment, the obligation is still with me. That event, which is the foundation of our friendship, of you being there for me, even though it was to your disadvantage. Sabari, I promise you that if you will ever be in need of support I will be there, like a loyal friend, as you were to me on that cold day in November during botany class—be it studying, a tough life situation, or anything else.
