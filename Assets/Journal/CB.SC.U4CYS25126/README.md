## Journal Record

Gratitude Journal
 
1.My friend who saved my day
 one week before, I was in a hurry to reach college, because i was getting late and ID cards were compulsory. After getting started to the college, I suddenly realized i had forgotten my ID card in my room. Just then, my friend called  and said she found my ID card. She immediately brought it to college, even though it meant taking extra effort and time. When she handed it to me with a smile ,I felt so relieved and thankful. Because of her, I could attend the class without any problem.
I'm grateful for my caring friend who helped me when i needed it most.

2. When i got my bag back
one month back, something small but important happened. I was in Vaishnavi mam's cabin discussing about my  project zero. After finishing, I came out and realized it was already late. When I went back to my classroom, it was locked and I had left my bag inside!
I started to panic because all my important notes and things were in that bag. Just then, I saw Saurabh sir leaving for home. I quickly told him what happened. He kindly stopped and told me, “Go and ask that maintenance staff  in the cabin for the keys.” I went to  that staff , and i explained the situation, and staff immediately helped me by giving the key. I opened the classroom, got my bag, and felt so relieved and thankful.
I'm grateful to Saurabh sir, and the maintenance staff who helped when i was new to this campus and i learnt that when we are honest and ask for help politely, there are always kind people ready to help us.

3. A Kind Bus Driver
This afternoon, I was getting late to class after lunch. When I reached the bus stop, I suddenly saw the college bus already starting to move. My heart started beating fast, and I began running as quickly as I could to catch it. The bus driver saw me running from a distance and, instead of driving away, he patiently waited for me to reach. I quickly got in, breathless but smiling, and said “Thank you, sir.” He just smiled back and said, “Be careful next time.”
That small act of kindness made my whole day better. Because of him, I reached class on time and didn’t get marked absent.
I’m grateful for the bus driver’s patience and kindness.
