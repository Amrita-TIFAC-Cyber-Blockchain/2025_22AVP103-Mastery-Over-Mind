# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

SCENARIO-1

DATE-02-11-2025

When I had to meet my class advisor after getting caught for using Chat-GBT in my PSAT project - 0 .

I feel genuinely grateful for my class advisor, Praveen sir. After Vaishnavi ma’am asked me to get his signature for internal marks—because I had used chat GBT for some part in my project—0 walked to his cabin feeling nervous and embarrassed. I expected disappointment or a lecture.

But instead, he surprised me.

He spoke to me calmly and politely, not judging me or making me feel small. He said, “Use AI in an appropriate way. Don’t just copy-paste. Learn from it.” His words didn’t feel like scolding—they felt like guidance. Instead of discouraging me, he reminded me that tools like AI are meant to support learning, not replace it.

I’m grateful for how understanding he was at a moment when I was already stressed. He turned a potentially negative situation into a learning experience. His kindness and practical advice made me reflect on how I should approach my studies with more sincerity and responsibility.

that day reminded me that a good advisor doesn’t just correct mistakes—they help you grow from them. And for that, I’m thankful.

SCENARIO-2

DATE-22-09-2025

When Ramaguru sir gave our team another chance to participate in SIH.

I feel truly grateful for Ramaguru sir, the incharge of SIH. Even though I made the same mistake twice—writing the team details improperly—he didn’t lose patience with me or reject our participation at first. Instead, he gave us some time to realize our mistake and gave a third chance, something most people wouldn’t do.
His willingness to guide us instead of shutting us down made a huge difference. It showed me that he genuinely wants students to learn, improve, and get opportunities, even when we mess up.

His support allowed our team to participate in SIH, and that means a lot to us. I’m grateful not only for the chance but also for the understanding and encouragement behind it.

that day reminded me that sometimes educators believe in us even when we make mistakes—and that is something worth appreciating deeply.

SCENARIO-3

DATE-7-08-2025

Remembering the first day at Amrita University when Harish (4th-year senior) helped me.

I feel deeply grateful for Harish anna, a senior from 4th year, who helped me on my very first day during induction at Amrita University. That day was already overwhelming—new campus, new faces, new environment. And in the middle of all that, I slipped and fell while walking. My nail broke, the pain hit instantly, and for a moment I didn’t know what to do.

But suddenly, Harish anna appeared out of nowhere and helped me without hesitation. He supported me while I was struggling to walk, made sure I didn’t lose balance, and even took me all the way to the hospital near the store. He didn’t treat me like a stranger; he treated me like a younger brother who needed help.

I still remember how reassuring his presence was. In a moment when I felt embarrassed, scared, and lost in a new place, his kindness made me feel safe. It was because of him that I got proper treatment quickly, and I could continue the day without further trouble.

That day when I look back, I realize how small acts of kindness can make a huge difference in someone’s life. I’m truly grateful for what he did for me that day. It made my first day at Amrita memorable in the best way possible.
