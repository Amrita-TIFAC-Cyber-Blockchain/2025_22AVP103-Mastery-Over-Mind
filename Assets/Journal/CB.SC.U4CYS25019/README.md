My gratefullness to Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi Devi)
             I am thankful for the way You teach us the value of selfless service, humility, and love for all beings. Through Your example, I’ve learned that true strength comes from compassion, and true success lies in serving others.

 Amma, Your words remind me to stay calm even in challenges, to forgive, and to see divinity in everyone I meet. Every hug, every smile, and every silence of Yours holds a 
message of peace and healing. you created such a fantasticand greeny environment for us to study

To  kind girl
 I met a kind girl in the washing area who truly made my day a little brighter. I had been standing there for quite some time, feeling hesitant and struggling to ask anyone for help. I needed a washing stone, but everyone seemed busy, and I didn’t know how to approach them.

Then, this girl noticed me. Without me even asking, she kindly called me over and gave me space in her washing stone. It might seem like a small act, but to me, it meant a lot. Her kindness and thoughtfulness reminded me that simple gestures can make a big difference.


To Anushree and Ridhanya
I want to take a moment to express my deep gratitude to my wonderful friends who have made my life so much easier and more meaningful. When I first started feeling homesick, they were the ones who stood by me, comforted me, and made this place feel like home.

They never let me feel alone — always including me, sharing laughter, and bringing warmth into my days. Their small acts of kindness, like bringing me delicious food from their homes, touched my heart deeply. It reminded me that friendship is one of the purest forms of love.

I’m also grateful for the way they patiently helped me with my studies — especially in Python and other subjects that I found difficult. They never hesitated to teach me, explain concepts again and again, and encourage me to do my best.

Because of them, I’ve not only learned lessons from books but also lessons about kindness, teamwork, and true friendship. They’ve shown me that friends can become family when hearts connect through care and support .
