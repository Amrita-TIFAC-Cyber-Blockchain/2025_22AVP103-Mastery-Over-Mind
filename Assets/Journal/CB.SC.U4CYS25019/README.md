My gratitude journel 

Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi Devi)
             I am thankful for the way You teach us the value of selfless service, humility, and love for all beings. Through Your example, I’ve learned that true strength comes from compassion, and true success lies in serving others.Amma, Your words remind me to stay calm even in challenges, to forgive, and to see divinity in everyone I meet. Every hug, every smile, and every silence of Yours holds a message of peace and healing. Today, I feel deeply grateful to Amrita Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi Devi) for creating such a wonderful, green, and peaceful environment around us. Amma’s vision of love and care for nature has made our surroundings so beautiful and refreshing — filled with positivity, trees, and harmony. The greenery she promotes reminds us of the importance of living close to nature and protecting it with love.Amma has also inspired us to take care of our mental health. Through meditation, yoga, and mindfulness practices, she encourages everyone to find inner peace and balance. Her teachings help us to calm our minds, understand our stress levels, and handle life’s challenges with strength and clarity.Because of Amma’s guidance, our campus is not just a place of learning — it is a space of peace, compassion, and emotional healing. I feel blessed to be part of her vision, where spiritual growth and mental well-being are valued as much as education.Thank you, Amma, for showing us the path of love, peace, and inner strength. Your presence fills our lives with light and serenity. Amma has also shown great concern for our mental health and inner peace. By including meditation as part of our subjects, she has given us a wonderful opportunity to relax our minds and connect with ourselves. These meditation sessions help us balance our stress levels, stay focused, and take care of both our mind and body.

Because of Amma’s guidance, our campus has become a place of growth — not only in knowledge but also in emotional and spiritual well-being. She inspires us to lead a balanced life filled with compassion, mindfulness, and self-awareness.
To  kind girl
 I met a kind girl in the washing area who truly made my day a little brighter. I had been standing there for quite some time, feeling hesitant and struggling to ask anyone for help. I needed a washing stone, but everyone seemed busy, and I didn’t know how to approach them.

Then, this girl noticed me. Without me even asking, she kindly called me over and gave me space in her washing stone. It might seem like a small act, but to me, it meant a lot. Her kindness and thoughtfulness reminded me that simple gestures can make a big difference.


To Anushree and Ridhanya
I want to take a moment to express my deep gratitude to my wonderful friends who have made my life so much easier and more meaningful. When I first started feeling homesick, they were the ones who stood by me, comforted me, and made this place feel like home.

They never let me feel alone — always including me, sharing laughter, and bringing warmth into my days. Their small acts of kindness, like bringing me delicious food from their homes, touched my heart deeply. It reminded me that friendship is one of the purest forms of love.

I’m also grateful for the way they patiently helped me with my studies — especially in Python and other subjects that I found difficult. They never hesitated to teach me, explain concepts again and again, and encourage me to do my best.

Because of them, I’ve not only learned lessons from books but also lessons about kindness, teamwork, and true friendship. They’ve shown me that friends can become family when hearts connect through care and support .
