# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Scenario 1:On 14 of october 2025 When I went to Charan’s room, I casually asked him if he could explain the Cybersecurity Essentials subject to me. I thought he might be busy or say “later,” but without even a small hesitation he said yes. He sat with me patiently and started explaining everything in a very simple way. Whatever doubts popped into my head, I kept asking, and he didn’t get irritated even once. He just continued helping me like it was nothing.
He stayed with me almost till midnight, making sure I actually understood every topic. At the end, he even promised that he’ll explain any subject to me whenever I need help, which honestly meant a lot. I really felt grateful in that moment because not everyone supports you like that. Charan proved he’s not just a classmate, he’s someone who genuinely wants to see me do well.

Scenario 2: I’m genuinely grateful for one senior from our CYS department. On orientation day, I got stuck with some issues during the document verification, and honestly, I had no idea how to sort it out. They told me to go to another academic block, but since I was completely new to the college, I didn’t even know which block was where. That bro didn’t just point me in some direction — he actually walked with me all the way to the block and helped me get everything sorted. Thanks to him, my document verification got completed that same day. Most seniors wouldn’t take that much effort, so his help really meant a lot to me.
And it didn’t stop there. He took my number later and met me on another day just to explain all the subjects in our department, the do’s and don’ts on campus, how we should behave with seniors, and all the important things I needed to know as a newcomer. Whenever I needed help, he was reachable anytime, not acting like a strict senior, but more like a friend who genuinely cared. Everything honestly started from that orientation day, and I’m still thankful for the way he supported me without even knowing me properly.

Scenario 3:I am very thankfull to my friend jashwanth when i first came to this campus he helped him to find out the campus and my classroom .First of all, I am really grateful for the way my friend supports me in every situation. Whether I am having a good day or a bad one, they always find a way to make me feel better. Even when I don’t say anything, they somehow understand that something is wrong and try their best to cheer me up. Not everyone gets a friend like that, and I feel lucky that I do.One thing I appreciate most is that my friend doesn’t judge me. I can talk freely about anything—small problems, personal issues, silly thoughts, or even my fears. They never make fun of me or make me feel embarrassed. Instead, they listen with patience and try to give me honest advice. For a student like me, who is still learning about life, this kind of friendship feels really safe and comforting.I am also thankful for the fun moments we share. Sometimes it’s not about big events but the small things we do together—like walking to school, sharing snacks, making jokes, laughing at random things, or just talking about our day. These moments might look simple, but they mean a lot to me. They make my day lighter and less stressful, especially when schoolwork feels too much.Another thing I truly value is how my friend motivates me. Whenever I feel like giving up or I lose confidence, my friend encourages me to keep going. They remind me of the goals I set and the progress I’ve already made. It’s nice to have someone who believes in you even when you don’t believe in yourself. Their words have helped me many times, especially during exams or when I felt stressed about something.
