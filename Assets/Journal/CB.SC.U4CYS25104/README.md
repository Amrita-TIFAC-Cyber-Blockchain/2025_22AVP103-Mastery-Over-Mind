# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1
Date: About a month after admission To: Kashyapa Bhavanam Wardens

About a month into my time at Amrita, my roommates and I started noticing a crack in my friend's tile near his bed. Slowly, we noticed it breaking and falling apart. For a couple of days, we ignored it and hid it under a rug. About a week later, while going to the mess, my friend cut his foot on the broken tile. It was not that big of a cut, but it still could have been worse. We decided to call the warden at an odd hour during the night, and after he heard what had happened, he immediately came to our room to inspect the tiles.

I really appreciated that he came immediately even though he could have come the next day. My gratitude lies with him because there could have been more accidents due to those broken tiles in the coming days if the warden had not come on time. As of today, 18/11/25, they have started the work, and it should be finished in 3 to 4 days. Thanks to him, we will now have a clean and safe room to walk, talk, run, and sleep in.

Scenario 2
Date: About a month after admission To: My hostel friends

On a weekend, I was down with a fever one night and slept without eating much the whole day. The next day I was drowsy and fainted outside my room. If my friends were not around, who knows what would have happened? Teeja helped me get up and took me to my bed where I went back to sleep. During all this, Nambi got me some ORS and food from the mess. Yashash called an ambulance and took me to the medical room. Over there, he paid for my medical charges and got me fruits to eat even though he had prior commitments. Thanks to them, I was fine within three days.

Scenario 3
Date: A week earlier To: MTech Senior

A week earlier, I was lost on how to go about learning cybersecurity and how to position myself for the upcoming courses and challenges. I walked up to a senior, and even though he could have just shared some generic knowledge, he gave me a flowchart on how to go about learning CYS. He also provided notes for different topics and is still keeping in touch with me, helping whenever I am lost or stuck on a certain problem.

Again, he could have given me some random words of advice, but he took the time to take my number and shared a couple of notes he had on his mobile on the spot. Some time later, he shared even more notes and a proper roadmap to follow. Bombarded by all these files, I really felt thankful towards him for taking the time to tell me how to tackle cybersecurity as a subject.
