# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1
Date: About a month after admission
To: Kashyapa Bhavanam Wardens

About a month in Amrita, my room mates and I started noticing a crack in my friends tile near his bed. Slowly we started noticing it break apart and fall apart.
We decided to inform the wardens and they quickly resolved the matter by calling in helpers to fix the tiles. If they did not take action spontaneously we could have cut our feet because of the broken tiles.

Scenario 2
Date: About a month after admission
To: My hostel friends

On a weekend I was down with fever on night and slept without eating much the whole day. The next day I was drowsy and fainted outside my room, if my friends were not around who knows what would have happened. They called an ambulance and took me to the medical room. Thanks to them I was not worrying about the external factors like money and how will I eat food as they had bought it for me.

Scenario 3
Date: A week earlier
To: Mtech Senior

A week earlier I was lost on how to go about learning cybersecurity and how to position myself for the upcoming courses and challenged. The senior had given me a flowchart on how to go about learning CYS. He had also provided notes for different topics and is still keeping in touch with me and helping me whenever I am lost or stuck in a certain problem.
