GRATITUDE JOURNAL

1.My friend Hasini
I feel very thankful now for my friend from intermediate. She has always been someone who shares everything with me, makes fun memories. When I joined college, I was feeling low because I couldn’t get in through JEE as I had hoped. I felt a little depressed and lonely in the beginning.
At that time, my friend really stood by me. Even though her college started late and she was at home, she called me often to check on me. She made sure I was eating well, studying properly, and not feeling alone. Her calls gave me comfort and made me feel cared for.
I never thought that a friend from intermediate would continue to think about me and care for me even when we are not together. Her kindness and support mean a lot to me.
I am truly grateful for her friendship. She showed me that real friends are those who care for you no matter the distance.

2.  My classmate

I'm truly thankful to him for his support and teamwork.

College is often described as a transformative journey—a time when we not only gain academic knowledge but also  relationships that shape our character and future. Among the many people I’ve met during this journey, one stands out as a of support, kindness, and collaboration: my classmate and hackathon teammate. 

 One such moment occurred during a lab session when I was struggling to get my program to work. Despite trying multiple approaches, I couldn’t figure out what was wrong.  I turned to him for help. Without hesitation, he agreed to take a look.
 He didn’t just see at my code and offer a quick fix—he stayed back after the session . He asked questions, suggested alternative methods, and encouraged me to think . Even when we couldn’t finish it within the allotted time, he didn’t give up. Instead, he took my laptop worked on the program and returned it to me.
 

3. An old uncle    
One day, my friend and I went to a nearby store to buy some items. When i reached the counter, i realized that the store only accepted cash payments. Unfortunately, i didn’t have any cash with me—only online payment options like PhonePe. I was unsure what to do, but then an elderly uncle who was also at the store noticed my situation. He kindly offered to help me by paying the bill in cash, and in return, we transferred the amount to him through PhonePe. since he didn’t know us personally. I’m truly thankful for his help that day.
