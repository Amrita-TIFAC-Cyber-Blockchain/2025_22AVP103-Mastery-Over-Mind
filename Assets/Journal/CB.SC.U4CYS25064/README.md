topic:gratidude general for three members
the three members that im gratitude of in amrita campus are
1) Date:2nd oct,2025 ,sreejith sir,our class advisor : when i needed to go home due to medical reason , ive messaged him at late nighgt, because he is kind , even he gave permission imediately when i needed .He motivated to study well in mid trm examinations.he has given me advices as i was new to college . he guided me to study well in exams.he not only encouraged me in studies but also in communication skills.sir s method of teaching and enthusiasm to educate change my perception to study Sreejith Sir is not just a teacher or advisor; he is a true mentor who listens to us with patience and kindness. Whenever we face problems—whether related to academics, personal matters, or future plans—he always encourages us to speak openly. He listens carefully without judgment and helps us find the best possible solutions. His support makes us feel safe, understood, and confident enough to face any difficulty.

 
2) Date:23rd oct,2025 ,charan : my hostel roommate,he is,helped me teaching subjects for midterm and was a good friend of me.. He is the best one which i got and im lucky to have him as my friend and people like hima re very rare. He has no ego and teaches me how many times till i understand the concept very well. I asked him multiple times, and without any anger or frustration, he explained it to me again and again. What I admire most in him is his patience and willingness to help others. He never makes me feel silly for not understanding something. His help has made me feel more confident in my classes. I am really lucky to have him as my friend and desk partner. He is a very kind person who truly cares about people.Sometimes we stay up late studying for exams, surrounded by open laptops, snacks, and music. Other times, we end up having deep late-night talks about life, dreams, or random funny memories. There are days when the room turns into a study zone, and days when it feels like a comedy club. of course, we fight too — about small things like who didn’t refill the water bottle or who used someone’s shampoo without asking. But no matter what, the fights never last.

 
3) Date:not a specific date  , MY friend pranay : He my friend since we were studying in 9th class and till now we are studying together. he helped me many situations that i cant count ,mostly in my acadamics and then he should also be thankfull of me ,because ive also helped him a lot (like acadamics ,ets),till my +2 ends i was a dayscholer and he was hosteller,he used to me inform me what happened in studyhours because my home is a bit long to travellel from collage i used to not stay for study hours. he never expected greetings (or) gratitude from me .
