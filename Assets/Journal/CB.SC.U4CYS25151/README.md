GRATITUDE JOURNAL
   SCENARIO 1 :(11-08-25)
Honestly I thank Bhavishya and Deepthi they are ones whom i met on the 4TH day of collage I am really glad that i met them we became close in a very short time. The first few days of collage were confusing and awkward but they made everything easy. every time i feel low they stay with me and take care of me. from finding classes to having someone to talk. I thank them for making this place feel a little more like home.Apart from  them I am also grateful that i met some wonderful people here(Maneesha,Nethra,amirtha,harshitha,mansi,sreekanth,advik,aadi,midhun cheta) they are the ones who make university so much more fun.
SCENARIO 2 :(8-08-25)
I thank my roommates they are very chill and understanding. We will share food have fun and they also help me when i have doubts, we never had misunderstandings between us they make our room lively.
SCENARIO 3:(2-10-25)
I am also thankful to my seniors whom i met in this collage they helped me with many things. Whenever i have problem in solving math questions they explained me very patiently they always motivate me whenever i am stressed about my academics, tell me how to face things in collage they always share their experiences so that i wont repeat those mistakes. When i forgot to take Gemini pro subscription they have given  me their account so that it would be useful.
