# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
## Journal Record
I am profoundly grateful to Sreenivasan sir, my maths teacher here, whose dedication and passion have deeply inspired me. I have never seen a person who puts in his whole and soul just to make us understand complex mathematical concepts. His teaching approach creates such a strong connection with students, including me, that no matter what happens outside the classroom, we feel assured and welcomed whenever he enters with his warm smile.
What makes Sreenivasan sir truly exceptional is his ability to transform maths lessons into entertaining and engaging experiences. He uses exciting methods and creative ways to explain even the toughest topics, ensuring that everyone enjoys learning and actively participates. This has made a significant difference in my learning journey as I look forward to every class with enthusiasm.
One of the most remarkable qualities of sir is his deep understanding of student mentality. He patiently grants us enough time often like 10 second pauses to absorb and process the material, allowing us to catch up and respond comfortably. This thoughtful pacing builds confidence and motivation among students, making learning less intimidating and more achievable.
My very first interaction with sir was during orientation when my parents spoke with him. From that moment, I felt a sense of warmth and happiness as he remembered me, smiled, and greeted me whenever we met. This simple gesture of acknowledgment has made me feel valued and cared for throughout my time here.
There was a day when I was experiencing a severe headache during his class and had to lie down. Sir noticed and came over gently to ask what was wrong. He thoughtfully offered to turn off the fan above my seat to make me more comfortable. His genuine concern in that moment made me feel truly happy and gifted—like I had a guardian looking out for me.

I want to express my deepest gratitude to Chithra Mam, our hostel warden, whose kindness and motherly care have been a pillar of strength to me. Being someone who is incredibly attached to my mother, coming to the hostel brought an overwhelming wave of homesickness that I struggled with. Adding to the challenge, I have specific health requirements—clean restrooms are essential for me to stay healthy. However, Chithra Mam has been my unwavering support through these difficult times.
One specific Sunday in August 2025, I was feeling exceptionally down and visibly sad. To my surprise and relief, Chithra Mam noticed my distress and approached me with such warmth and sweetness. She reassured me with kind words, telling me that it would be alright and that I would soon enjoy life in the hostel. She told me she would always be there for me, which gave me a comfort akin to a mother's embrace.
Her attentiveness went beyond words. When the restrooms were once in a poor state of cleanliness—something that I, due to my health concerns, dread—she listened with patience and immediately took action, instructing the helper to clean them thoroughly. Such prompt care made me feel safe and cared for.
Moreover, she is one of the few people in the hostel who make a genuine effort to check on me regularly—asking if I am fine, if I have eaten, and always greeting me with a warm smile and a wave. She even helps me with all the passes and administrative support, making my life much easier here.
In many ways, Chithra Mam gives me a motherly feeling in this hostel far from home. Her compassion has been a beacon of light for me, and I am eternally thankful for her presence in my life.

I am truly grateful to my friend Bhavana in countless ways. When I first came here feeling completely homesick and struggling with my roommates, only to be placed in a different section where I knew no one, she was the first person I found approachable. The moment I asked if I could sit beside her, she welcomed me warmly, instantly giving me a sense of comfort that I desperately needed.
Bhavana showed genuine care when she learned about my homesickness. On my birthday, the 12th of August, when I felt particularly isolated and cried, she stood by my side, offering a sense of friendship and comfort that was profoundly reassuring. She is truly a genuine and pure soul.
Although we started just as benchmates, over time Bhavana has become the one person I can share anything with, knowing I will never face judgment. I trust her completely. She even encourages me to eat when I resist and often pays for me, small gestures that mean the world to someone as sensitive as I am.
She gives me the feeling of having school friends here, always offering support in class and patiently waiting for me while coming back. Though these actions might seem small, for an emotional and sensitive person like me, they are immense. Bhavana has truly become an irreplaceable part of my life.
I am forever grateful to her and will always stand by her through everything.
