# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Today, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to some very important people in my academic life. First and foremost, I am deeply thankful to Mr. Ramguru Sir, my MAOM course teacher. I am really grateful for the opportunity he has given me to write this gratitude journal. Beyond academics, Sir has been a tremendous support, encouraging us to participate in hackathons and guiding us through various challenges. I am grateful for his constant effort to resolve our issues within the college, showing genuine care for our well-being and success.
I would also like to thank Chithra Mam, our hostel warden. Even though she is away from her own family, she dedicates herself wholeheartedly to supporting us. Her friendliness and empathy create a warm and comforting atmosphere in the hostel. I am especially thankful for how quickly she listens to my problems and takes immediate action to address them. Her care means a lot to all of us living here.
Finally, I am really grateful to my class representative. Regardless of the time, we go to him with problems or troubles, he always stands by us. He represents us in every situation, consistently addressing our concerns and providing unwavering support throughout. His dedication and willingness to help make a big difference in our college life.
I feel truly blessed to have these wonderful individuals guiding and supporting me throughout my academic journey. Their kindness and dedication inspire me every day, and I am thankful for all they do to help me and my peers grow.
