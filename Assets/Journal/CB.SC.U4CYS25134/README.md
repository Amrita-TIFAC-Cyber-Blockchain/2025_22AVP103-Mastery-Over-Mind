# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Gratitude Journal

scenario 1: I show gratitude towards my dear friend Tharun because he always helped me when I was in my hardest times, I can never forget his help. I am always grateful for his friendship throughout my entire life. He always helps the people in need, and doesn't show any gut feelings on anyone, his positivity always spreads like a charm

scenario 2: I show gratitude towards Mata Amritanandamayi for the beautiful college she had built considering the beauty of those mountains right beside the university, no matter how many colleges I see, I can never overcome the beauty of this college-the trees, the weather. Nothing is the same when we go out of this college, something lies in this college which cannot be comprehended

scenario 3: I am thankful to the teachers for their mesmerising teaching skills, which I wonder if there is teaching like this in
top colleges. Each and every concept is explained with a real life example which makes it easier for the students to understand hard topics. Each lecturer has a unique skill which keeps them diverse and the students curious.
