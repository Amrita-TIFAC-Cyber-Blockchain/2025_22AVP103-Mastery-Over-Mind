# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Bus anna 
In the morning, it was raining. The bus usually starts at 7:15 from the starting point, but he waited there until 7:25 for me because I was coming on my scooty and driving in the rain was difficult. Even though it made him late for college, he still waited for me.
Reason:
It was raining heavily, and riding the scooty was difficult, so he waited to make sure I reached safely.


## cleaner anna in canteen 
The way he cleans the canteen every day and keeps the place neat.
How he patiently arranges all the chairs and tables even when students leave a mess.
His friendly smile and respectful behaviour towards everyone.

Reason
His efforts often go unnoticed, but they make a big difference in our daily college life.


## Harshini friend 
Always being by my side in class and outside.
Helping me with notes, assignments, and doubts without hesitation.
Making college life more fun with sharing your happiness and also your problems.

Reason:
Good friend .Their support reminds me I am not alone and I’m lucky to have someone who cares.
