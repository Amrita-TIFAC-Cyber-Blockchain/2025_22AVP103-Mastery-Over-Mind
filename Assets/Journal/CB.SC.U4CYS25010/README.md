## Journal Record
Three persons i am grateful towards in Amrita University:
1.Ramaguru Sir(MaOM Faculty Member)
2.Priya (My senior)
3.Hemachandra (B.tech junior CSE core student)
1 -- On 28th of October 2025, Ramaguru sir came to our class and enquired our queries towards our PSAT faculty and her teaching.
He conveyed our problems to madam and he invested most of his valuable time towards this problem and figured out some solutions in order to make us understand the subject and solve our query. He suggested some of the advices to madam from his previous teaching experience to make children understand the subject.
2 -- On 17th October 2025, i was preparing for my physics mid term examination then i remembered that i am not having any calculator for the complex calculations in the examination. So i informed her about the situation then she came near my hostel gave me her calculator. With the help of her calculator i was able to calculate the complex calculations in exam. She helped me at that peak time and  i am very grateful to her as she also helped in many situations in my early period in this college.
3 -- On 14th October 2025, I am feared towards my PSAT because i am not aware of flowgarithms topic in PSAT. Then he conveyed me his knowledge towards flowgarithms topic. So, I was somewhat able to write the answers for questions on the topic of flowgarithms. And he also helped me face many tough situations during examinations. So i am very grateful to him.
