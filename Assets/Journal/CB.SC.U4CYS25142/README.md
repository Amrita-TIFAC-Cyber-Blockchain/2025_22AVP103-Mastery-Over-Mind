# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind

## NAME Journaling 

Scenario 1
date-august 07
whom: sree sai(Friend) 
When I first came to college, honestly everything just felt all over the place for me. I didn’t understand where anything was, and I was kinda just walking around without any clue. Too many new faces and I felt like I didn’t fit anywhere. Then suddenly I saw my school friend Sree Sai , that moment felt like I finally saw someone from my own world. He joined few days before me, so he already knew most of the stuff. He didn’t even ask me what happened, he just looked at my face and understood I’m totally lost, and he started helping me around the campus. That small thing made me feel so much better.Because we already knew each other, talking to him was easy, I didn’t have to think too much what to say. If I looked confused, he would just step in and explain things. Finding classes, understanding timetable, all those small things he explained in a chill way. When I think now, those days would have been really hard without him. He didn’t do anything big-big, but those small helps mattered a lot. I really feel grateful that he was there exactly when I needed someone familiar.

SCENARIO 2
Date: from the college days
Whom:cleaning staff who clean our corridor and bathrooms
If I think honestly, the people who help us the most in college daily are actually the cleaning staff. They keep our corridor, classrooms, bathrooms everything clean, but most of us don’t even notice properly. Early morning when we are still sleepy or rushing to get ready, they already started sweeping and mopping. Their work is not easy at all, but they still do it very patiently. Because of them, we start our day in a clean place. I really feel thankful for that.But many times we just pass by them like normal. They clean our mess also without saying anything. Even a small smile or thank you from us makes them so happy, I saw that. They don’t get much attention, but their work keeps our whole college running smoothly without anyone realising it. They remind me that no job is small. And honestly I have a lot of respect for them. I’m really grateful for everything they do everyday for us.

SCENARIO 3
Date: November 16
whom: Yashwanth
I wanted to thank you because on 16th November (Sunday), I was feeling tensed about cyber essentials exam, which is on Monday. I think time was around 9pm at that time.You came and understood my situation and explained me the concept but while explaining you realised that you didn’t wash your school uniform, even though it was late night and you don’t have uniform for tomorrow to wear, you explained me the concept completely and then washed your clothes. Honestly many people wont do that. It looks like a small thing, but I wanted to thank as you even postponed your work to explain me.
