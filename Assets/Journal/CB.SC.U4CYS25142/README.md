# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Scenario 1
date-august 07
whom: sree sai(Friend) 
When I first joined college, everything felt new and confusing. Even though I was excited, the  environment made me nervous, and I struggled to adjust. Seeing many new faces around me made me feel lonely. During this time, meeting my school friend Sree Sai on campus felt like a big relief. He had joined a few days earlier, so he already knew how things be, and he helped through the campus and helped me understand.Because we already knew each other from school, I felt comfortable talking to him. He noticed when I looked confused or lost and helped in without me even asking. Whether it was finding classrooms, understanding the schedule, or knowing out where to go, he made those first days so much easier. What really mattered to me was how genuine and friendly he was—he made sure I didn’t feel like I was facing everything alone.Looking back, I realise how important his presence was during my early days of college. His small acts of kindness, his support, and the way he made things feel simpler helped me settle in with confidence. I’m truly grateful to him for being there exactly when I needed someone familiar. Those initial days would have been much harder without him.
SCENARIO 2
Date: from the college days
Whom:cleaning staff who clean our corridor and bathrooms
The people who truly make our college life easier are the cleaning staff. They are the reason our corridors, classrooms, and bathrooms are clean every day. Early in the morning, when most students are still sleeping, they are already sweeping, mopping, and washing everything. Their work is not easy, but they still do it calmly and without expecting anything in return. Because of them, we start our day in a neat and comfortable place, and I feel very thankful for that.We may see them every day, but many of us forget how important their work is. They clean up the mess we create and make sure everything looks fresh again, even on the busiest or dirtiest days. Sometimes, just saying “thank you” or smiling at them makes a big difference. They might not stand on a stage or get attention, but their hard work keeps our college running smoothly. They remind us that every job deserves respect. I’m truly grateful for their effort, and I appreciate everything they do to make our surroundings clean and comfortable.
SCENARIO 3
Date: During my initial hostel days
whom: My Roomates
When I first came to the hostel, I was nervous and unsure of how I would adjust. Staying away from home for the first time felt strange, and I didn’t know what kind of people I would be living with. But everything changed when I met my roommates. Their friendly, welcoming nature made me feel relaxed from day one. Slowly, our room started to feel less like a hostel and more like a small home. From late-night talks and movie jokes to sharing food, studying together, and helping each other, they turned what could have been a difficult experience into one filled with comfort, laughter, and warmth.They’ve been there for me through every mood — cheering me up when I felt homesick, supporting me before exams, and taking care of me like siblings would. Even our silly fights about chargers, snacks, or towels now feel like special memories. They taught me how to share, adjust, forgive, and live like a team. To me, they are not just roommates; they are my second family. They make me smile more, feel less alone, and truly feel at home even when I’m far from my real home. I’m genuinely grateful for them and all the moments we’ve created together.
