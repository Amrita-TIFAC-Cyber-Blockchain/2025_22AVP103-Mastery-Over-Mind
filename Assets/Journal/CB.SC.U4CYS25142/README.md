# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Scenario 1
date-august 07
whom: sree sai(Friend) 
When I first came to college, honestly everything just felt all over the place for me. I didn’t understand where anything was, and I was kinda just walking around without any clue. Too many new faces and I felt like I didn’t fit anywhere. Then suddenly I saw my school friend Sree Sai and bro, that moment felt like I finally saw someone from my own world. He joined few days before me, so he already knew most of the stuff. He didn’t even ask me what happened, he just looked at my face and understood I’m totally lost, and he started helping me around the campus. That small thing made me feel so much better.Because we already knew each other, talking to him was easy, I didn’t have to think too much what to say. If I looked confused, he would just step in and explain things. Finding classes, understanding timetable, all those small things he explained in a chill way. When I think now, those days would have been really hard without him. He didn’t do anything big-big, but those small helps mattered a lot. I really feel grateful that he was there exactly when I needed someone familiar.
SCENARIO 2
Date: from the college days
Whom:cleaning staff who clean our corridor and bathrooms
If I think honestly, the people who help us the most in college daily are actually the cleaning staff. They keep our corridor, classrooms, bathrooms everything clean, but most of us don’t even notice properly. Early morning when we are still sleepy or rushing to get ready, they already started sweeping and mopping. Their work is not easy at all, but they still do it very patiently. Because of them, we start our day in a clean place. I really feel thankful for that.But many times we just pass by them like normal. They clean our mess also without saying anything. Even a small smile or “thank you” from us makes them so happy, I saw that. They don’t get much attention, but their work keeps our whole college running smoothly without anyone realising it. They remind me that no job is small. And honestly I have a lot of respect for them. I’m really grateful for everything they do everyday for us.
SCENARIO 3
Date: During my initial hostel days
whom: My Roomates
When I came to hostel for the first time, I was honestly scared because I didn’t know how I will adjust. First time staying away from home felt weird, like I’m in some new world. But when I met my roommates, things changed so fast. They talked so friendly from the very first day, and slowly slowly I felt comfortable. After some days, our room didn’t feel like hostel room only… it felt more like small home. Late night talks, sharing snacks, watching movies on one phone, studying together before exams — these things made hostel life actually fun for me.They’ve been with me in all moods. When I missed home too much, they cheered me up. When I was stressed, they joked around until I laughed. Even our small silly fights about charger or food are funny now when I think back. Living with them taught me to share, adjust, forgive small things and just live like a team. For me they are not just roommates — they’re literally like my second family now. They made hostel feel like place I belong. I’m really grateful for them and all the moments we made together.
