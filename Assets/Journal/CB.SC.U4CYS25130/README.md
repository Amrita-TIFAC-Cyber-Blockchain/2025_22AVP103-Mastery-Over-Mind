# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
7th october 2025 - SCENERIO 1

I woke up knowing it was going to be a busy, stressful day, and in the rush, I completely missed eating anything. By the time I was on the bus heading back to the hostel, my body was giving up. The world was tilting every time the bus turned a corner, and a cold sweat made me realize just how weak I was. I was starting to feel genuinely scared being so far from home and feeling so unwell.

My first thought was the mess hall. I needed something simple, cold, and fast. I rushed in, hoping for the buttermilk—the perfect thing that always brings me back to life. But when I got there, the dispenser was dry, and all the clean glasses were gone. That small disappointment, combined with the dizziness, felt like a huge wall. I stood there, feeling helpless and on the verge of tears.

And then there was Harshitha.

She was standing nearby, holding her own glass of buttermilk. She must have seen the defeated look on my face and how unsteady I was. Without a word, she walked straight up to me and simply handed me her full glass. "Drink this," she insisted gently. I protested, trying to tell her no, that she should drink it, but she just gave me the kindest, firmest look. She said, "You need it right now. I'll get another one later."

Her simple act of giving up her own comfort, something she wanted, for my immediate need was an overwhelming kindness. It wasn't just a drink; it was an anchor. The cold, tangy buttermilk instantly helped the spinning stop. That small, everyday moment of her sacrificing her own refreshment made me feel deeply, truly cared for. It reminded me that even when my family is miles away, I have people here who see me, notice when I’m struggling, and step in with silent, powerful support.

The transition would have been far more arduous without the immediate comfort of my living situation. After coming here, I was lucky to get very good roommates-Nethra,Amirtha,and Harshitha who are characterized by their remarkable kindness and helpfulness. Nethra is the one who brings life to our room . Harshitha and e have the same music taste. Amirtha , she is so kind always ready to help. Because of them, my days have become very good with their consistent and cheerful presence. I actually enjoy their company immensely, and our shared space is characterized by laughter, support, and an effortless rhythm that defies our diverse backgrounds.
In our room, four different languages are a reflection of four different identities. One might think that this would give rise to communication problems or possibly even cultural conflicts over the choice of music or the TV channel, but this is not the case at all. We've developed a shared, hybrid means of communication, basically a combination of English, basic elements from each other's language, and especially non-verbal means and intuition. And this linguistic variety doesn't impede our unity; it is what gives depth and value to our friendship. Language differences notwithstanding, they are never absent when I need to discuss anything, from the campus registration system to a midnight snack. They embody the principle that empathy transcends vocabulary.


August 18th, 2025 - SCENERIO 3 

The most recent, and perhaps most telling, manifestation of this supportive campus culture came when I was facing my version of a technological meltdown. Stuck with a serious problem in my laptop that jeopardized an important assignment, I went in search of help, panicking. The person whom I approached was one with whom I had interacted previously in passing, transactional conversations only,Sreekanth. The exchange that ensued turned out to be one of genuine, selfless altruism. He didn't just provide a quick fix or refer me to a service center. He became fully invested in my problem. He helped me till the time I was stuck in that, meticulously troubleshooting, researching solutions, and patiently explaining the technical jargon. His commitment was total. Now, we are good friends. The crisis forged a deep, appreciative bond. Surprisingly, he is younger than me, but sometimes behaves like an older brother. He gives sensible advice about college life without being asked to, asks about my progress from time to time, and has a maturity that belies his age. This unexpected connection-a result of a technical glitch-has given me one of the most heartwarming relationships here. So, I can say that it was also a good day because in a friend, I found a little brother.
