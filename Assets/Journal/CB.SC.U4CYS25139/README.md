# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1
Date: 3 months ago
I would like to thank Arunima from my class who taught me shortcut pathways which I could use to reach the entrance while walking from AB3. This helped me save a lot of time and energy.

Scenario 2
Date: 3.5 months ago 
I would like to thank the cleaning staff for maintaining the classrooms in a very neat manner. I once asked them if they could clean the boards. From them on they cleaned the board every week. Hence I would specially like to thank them for cleaning the board that appears so clean when I enter the classroom every week. The same board that appeared full of dust the previous week now shone brightly.

Scenario 3
Date: 2 months ago
I would like to thank my bus mate who convinced the bus driver to wait for me when I was late to come to the main bus parking. If it were not for her timely action, I would have missed my bus.
