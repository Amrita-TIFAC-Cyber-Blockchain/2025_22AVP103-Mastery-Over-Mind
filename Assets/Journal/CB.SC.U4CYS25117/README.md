## Journal Record
To a Stranger-
One rainy evening, I was heading back to my hostel after a long day in town. The sky had been cloudy all afternoon, but I didn't think much of it. I figured I would get back before the rain started. However, just as I reached the main road, the clouds opened up, and heavy rain poured down in thick sheets. Within minutes, the streets were glistening with water, and people ran in every direction looking for shelter.

I hadn’t brought an umbrella or a raincoat. The wind was cold, and the rain kept coming. Before I could find proper cover, I was completely soaked. I ran toward a small bus stop, hoping to stay dry. My clothes clung to my skin, and my shoes squelched with every step. I reached for my phone to call a cab or text a friend, but as I unlocked it, the screen went black, my battery had died.

For a moment, I just stood there, feeling helpless and unsure of what to do next. The road was almost empty, and the rain showed no signs of stopping. The sound of raindrops hitting the tin roof of the bus stop filled the air, blending with the distant honks of vehicles struggling through the flooded streets.

Then a soft voice broke my thoughts. “Do you want to share my umbrella?” I looked up to see a young woman smiling at me, holding out her umbrella despite being half-soaked herself. I was surprised by her kindness; after all, she didn’t know me. Before I could think too much, she moved a bit closer, making room for me under the umbrella.

We began walking together toward the main road, trying to fit under the small umbrella that barely covered us both. We laughed about how useless umbrellas seemed in such heavy rain. As we walked, we talked about college life, our favorite foods, and how unpredictable the weather always was that season. Despite being strangers, the conversation flowed easily. For those few minutes, it felt like I was walking with an old friend.

When we finally reached a spot where autos were available, she helped me hail one and made sure the driver knew the way to my hostel. I wanted to thank her properly for her kindness, but before I could say much, she smiled, waved goodbye, and disappeared into the crowd, leaving me speechless yet deeply touched.

During my ride back to the hostel, I couldn’t stop thinking about that small but meaningful encounter. In a world where everyone seems to be in a hurry, it’s rare to find someone who stops to help another person without expecting anything in return. Her gesture may have been simple—sharing an umbrella and having a brief conversation—but it meant a lot to me.

That day, I realized how impactful small acts of kindness can be. They don’t just shield you from the rain; sometimes, they remind you that goodness still exists in unexpected places, and brief moments can leave lasting warmth in your heart.
To a Parents-
There are many moments in my life when I’ve taken my parents for granted. I didn't fully appreciate their patience, sacrifices, and quiet, unconditional love. Growing up, I missed the countless little things they did for me behind the scenes. But every time I come home from university, those realizations hit me again. When I step inside, everything feels lighter. I sense the familiar smell of home-cooked food, see the warmth in my mother’s smile, and feel the calm reassurance in my father’s presence.

My mom’s food is the greatest comfort in the world. No fancy restaurant or cafeteria meal can compare. It’s not just about the taste; it’s the love she puts into every dish. She knows exactly what I like — I prefer less spice, I always ask for extra chutney, and I sneak bites straight from the kitchen counter while she pretends to scold me. Every meal feels like a silent hug, telling me, “You’re home. You’re safe now.”

My dad shows his love in a quieter way. He doesn’t say much, but his actions say it all. Before every return trip to campus, he double-checks my train ticket, makes sure my wallet has enough cash, and reminds me to take my charger, ID, and umbrella. Sometimes I laugh and tell him I can handle it, but deep down, I know those small gestures show he cares — his way of saying, “I love you. Be safe.”

One particular memory stands out in my mind. During my exam week at university, I got sick with a bad fever. I felt weak, tired, and overwhelmed with assignments. That’s when my mom started calling me every single night, no matter how late it was. She would patiently ask if I had eaten, taken my medicine, and rested enough. Even through the phone, her voice carried the warmth of home — calm, loving, and comforting. Hearing her somehow made the fever feel a little less miserable.

My dad played his part too, in his own subtle way. He sent short, simple texts — “Sleep well,” “Don’t stress too much,” or “Drink water.” To anyone else, those might seem like ordinary messages, but to me, they meant everything. They were small reminders that even from far away, my parents were always looking out for me.
to my English Teacher-
During my school years, one teacher really changed how I saw myself. Back then, I wasn’t a very confident student. I often stayed quiet in class, even when I knew the answer. I feared making mistakes or being laughed at. I admired the students who spoke confidently and wondered how they sounded so sure of themselves. Deep down, I wished I could do the same, but self-doubt always held me back.

My English teacher, however, saw something in me that I couldn’t see in myself. She had a calm confidence that made everyone pay attention. Her voice was gentle but firm. She made her students feel understood. Unlike most teachers who focused only on grades, she focused on potential. She noticed the smallest details: how I wrote essays with emotion, how I stayed after class to ask questions, and how my eyes lit up during literature discussions.

One day, out of the blue, she called me aside after class. I remember her words clearly: “You have a way with words. Why don’t you try participating in the upcoming speech competition?” My heart nearly stopped. Me? Speaking on stage? Just the thought made my palms sweat. I quickly tried to refuse, mumbling something about not being good enough. But she smiled and said, “I’ll help you prepare. You can do this.”

Over the next few days, she spent extra time with me after school. She helped me draft my speech and practice it aloud. Every time I stumbled or forgot a line, she was patient. She corrected my grammar, taught me how to vary my tone, and encouraged me to make eye contact with the audience. More importantly, she showed me that confidence doesn’t come from being perfect; it comes from believing in yourself.

The day of the competition arrived, and I was a bundle of nerves. Standing on stage in front of a crowd of students and teachers, my hands trembled and my throat went dry. For a moment, I almost froze. But then, I spotted her in the audience, smiling at me with quiet reassurance. That one look gave me the courage I needed. I took a deep breath and began to speak.
