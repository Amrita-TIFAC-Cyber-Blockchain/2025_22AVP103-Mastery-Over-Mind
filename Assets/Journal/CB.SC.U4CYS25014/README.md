# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

Hostel Teacher

It was 9:00 PM on the night of November 12th. This particular moment, which was quite normal at that time, is now the event that I can trace the origin of my friendship with you the unexpected one. Your amazing gesture of generosity and patience is the reason.We, you and I, were not friends from the very beginning. Our friendship was just a happy accident you shared a room in a hostel with my classmate. I am a person who usually tries to figure out things on my own and is often stubborn, but this particular assignment was a challenge too high for me to climb. It was a coding task, deeply entrenched in Python, and I was completely lost.I vividly remember entering your room with my heart racing. The feeling that goes with this is a mixture of anxiety and embarrassment. To ask for help in programming, a technical area, is like giving up. I might have been quite incoherent when I told you about the problem I had with the assignment, and I was bracing myself for the very short and quick guidance that a student who is in a hurry most likely would give.However, you, Pragateeshwar, chose to do something totally different.The Gift of Unhurried TimeYou didn't just hand me the solution, but you also brought me your time.After postponing your own assignment, you came over, and rather than jumping to the solution, you got me to explain the problem from the very beginning. From 9:00 PM onwards, for what felt like forever (but was exactly one hour and thirty minutes), you were fully committed to my confusion.That time of an hour and a half was not just about mending a few lines of code; it was a great lesson in real mentorship. For you, it was not a chore to finish my assignment, rather it was a challenge that we would conquer together.When I didn’t understand the concept of loops for the third time, you didn’t react negatively or check the time. Instead, you sketched a diagram, gave an example of stairs, and explained the basic principle again until the "Aha!" moment finally came in my head.We did exactly what was necessary for me no more, no less. You instructed me on list comprehensions, the correct way of writing a function, and how to debug error messages without becoming nervous. It was not about a quick solution; it was about setting a foundation so that I would not have to seek the same assistance next week.You were really nice: There was no judgment in your voice. No feeling of being intellectually superior. Merely a calm, focused, and friendly eagerness to see me succeed. It was that kindness which converted a simple transaction into a relation.What most struck me during those 1.5 hours was that you were completely indifferent to time. In the hectic life of a student where every minute is accounted for studying, eating, or catching up on sleep, to give up 90 minutes of your valuable evening is a great sacrifice. You didn’t worry about missing a meal or delaying your work. Your only concern was that I learned the Python concepts I needed.Beyond the CodeThe task is long done, handed in, and probably forgotten by my professor. But the lesson I took that night has remained with me: the real worth of human interaction and giving without expecting anything in return.Your assistance that day went beyond school work. It made me understand the concept that if you want help, first you have to help others, the indomitable patience it takes to be with a struggling person and, the mere fact that some of the best friendships originate from the most unanticipated situations—like a flickering laptop screen and vexing lines of code.Thanks a lot, Pragateeshwar. Thanks for the Python knowledge. Thanks for the 90 minutes of your time. But above all, thank you for being the friend who not only teaches the subject but also the delight of learning. That night of November 12th was an unforeseen blessing, and I am lucky to have you as a friend.I treasure your attitude being unselfish and showing the patience on November 12th at 9:00 PM. It will remind me to Share my knowledge and time with others just like you ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌did.

Gratitude Sai - The Math Teacher.

Out of all the study hurdles in midterms. The math test loomed the largest for me. I walked into it feeling shaky. Doubt filled my head. My mind spun with overload. Right when my self-assurance started to slip. My friend Sai came through for me.

He sat down and spent real time listening. He got what troubled me most. Then he walked me through the tough spots slowly. No hurry marked his pace. He never made me feel bad for gaps in my grasp. He split hard ideas into easy pieces. We worked problems out as a team. He made sure I truly understood. Not just repeated moves without thought.

His effort sprang from true bonds. Not some sense of duty.

This showed me what friendship really means.

A Friend in Need is a Friend in Deed.

With Sai's direction and boosts. I faced the math test steady. Fear lost its grip. The facts I picked up mattered a lot. The backing meant even more though. I owe him deep thanks. Not only for the study aid. But for the steady words. The insight he shared. The loyalty he brought.



To Sibi sir
I truly appreciate Sibi sir for being such a warm and approachable person. His friendly nature makes interactions easy and comfortable, encouraging open conversations and free exchange of ideas. His support and positivity have helped me gain confidence and stay motivated in my studies. I admire his patience, clarity in communication, and the respect he shows to everyone around him. People like him leave a meaningful and lasting impression on those they meet.
