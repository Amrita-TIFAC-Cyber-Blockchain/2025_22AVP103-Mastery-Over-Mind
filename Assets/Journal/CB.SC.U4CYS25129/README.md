## Journal Record

SCENARIO 1
DATE: 13TH OCTOBER 2025
TO: Rajaneesh , Aparna , security guard
I Lost my spectacles near the swimming pool area - AB3 on 11th October. At that i did not realize , I realised it on 13th October only that they were missing. I searched for it everywhere where i went that day after class, went to IT canteen, general store  hostel rooms and swimming pool area. TWhile i was searching there was a security guard near the swimming pool gate who noticed that im searching for something and offered to help me with finding my specs around that area but still I could not find them. After searching i posted in few studentd group that my specs has been lost but that was of no use as no one replyed. I lost hope as there were no replays even after two days of posting them , then I found out that a guy posted my specs picture on the same day that i lost my specs(11th october) but i wasnt paying much attention before. Rajaneesh from CSE DEPT took it and kept it safe and Aparna of his class helped me to get it from him. I want to sincerely thank the security guard, Rajaneesh, and Aparna for their support. Their actions may seem small, but to me, they meant a lot. I’ll always remember this as a moment.

SCENARIO 2
DATE: 26TH OCTOBER 2025
TO: Wardens , a unknown person who found my id card my class advisor
On 26th october after returning back to campus with my friends,  I lost my ID CARD near the main entrance gate, i realized as soon as i reached my room that my ID card was missing, But it was hostel gate closing time so I went and searched for it the next day but I was not able to find them.I looked around around that area , asked the security guards but still i could find it. I felt helpless because i know that i lost my id card but yet i couldnt find it. So i became nervous and approached my class advisor for this. He resolved this by asking me to get a new ID card. By miracle the same day  evening the hostel wardens found them and called me and gave back my ID card. They scolded me for being a first year and being so careless , but i was honestly so releved that they got my ID card back. I don’t know who exactly found it, but someone clearly cared enough to hand it over to the wardens instead of ignoring it or leaving it lying around.I feel really grateful to the wardens for taking the time to contact me and return it. And I’m also thankful to the person who found it and made sure it reached the warden. Even though I don’t know who they are, I hope they know how much their small act of kindness meant to me.At last my class advisor who told me to get a new one instead of worrying. Even though i got my ID card back yet im grateful that he was willing to help me that time.

SCENARIO 3
TO: Nethra , dithy , tanvi , sathwika , deva dharshni , kaviya
I feel really thankful for Nethra, dithy , tanvi , sathwika , deva dharshni , kaviya. These people are always with me, no matter what. When I feel confused or lost, they are there. When I don’t understand something in class, or I have some doubt, these guys help how much ever times i ask. They helped me with installing softwares, clearing doubts, and even explaining things again and again when I don’t get it. They never make me feel bad for asking. That means a lot to me.But it’s not just about studies. They also stay with me, talk to me, laugh with me, and make me feel like I’m not alone. When I feel low or demotivated, these people cheer me up. Even if I don’t say anything, these guys understand. Sometimes I feel very stressed. But when I sit with them, or even just hear  them, I feel better. They make me feel safe and happy here because it was little bit .Thankfull to them so much for being in my life. I will never forget their kindness and support.They all are like my strength. I feel blessed to have friends like them.
