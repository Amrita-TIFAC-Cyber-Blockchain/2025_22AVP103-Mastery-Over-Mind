I Lost my spectacles near the swimming pool area - AB3 on 11th October but I realised it on 13th October only. I searched for it everywhere, there was a security guard near the swimming pool gate who helped me with finding my specs but still I did not get them. Then after two days I found out that a guy called Rajaneesh from CSE DEPT took it and kept it safe and Aparna of his class helped me to get it from him. I feel thankful for the security guard , Rajaneesh and Aparna for getting my glass.

After going out with my friends, I lost my ID CARD near the main entrance gate. I went and searched for it the next day but I was not able to find them. The same day the hostel wardens found them and called me and gave back my ID card. I feel grateful for the Wardens for returning it back and I don't know who found it but I'm grateful to them as well.
