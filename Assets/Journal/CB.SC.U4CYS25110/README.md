I am thankfull to my senior Aryana roy brother because he encouraged me to participate in outdoor game due to that i am able to reduce my stress ,able to concerntrate in my studies.It happened on september ending I met him , we started a normal conversation in the middle of conversation he asked me "DO you play any out door game". I replied that I dont play any outdoor game.Because i dont have many friends to play . He said me that we should play outdoor games due to that our mental stress will be released.I used to think that who will go play games let me watch some reels and see some anime and web series.but atleast i used go out for a small walk after when i had my dinner .During assignments and exams that activity also i amm unable to do. Due to more screen time i used to get headache and stress to my eyes.and i am unable to sleep properly like not getting sleep at correct time.now following the word of aryana roy anna i can see a change in my body like i am able to sleep at correct time and i can release my stress whwn i play games. The time when i play games i used to forget all the things and I got some friend from ifferent departments and get to know some seniors from different department.Due to release of the stress now i am able to concentrate on my academics properly
