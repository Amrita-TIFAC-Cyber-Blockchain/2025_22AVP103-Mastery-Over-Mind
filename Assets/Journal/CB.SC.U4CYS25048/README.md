# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
## Journal Record
person 1 : watchman
I really want to write about how grateful I am for the watchman at the Academic Block 3 gate. I don't even know his name, but he makes my day feel a little better.
Every day, almost like a routine, he asks me what I ate and how the food was. It's such a simple question, but it feels like someone is looking out for me.
Sometimes I'll complain and say the food wasn't nice. He always smiles a little and says, "It's okay, you have to learn to live with it." And then he'll add something that really sticks with me: "At least eat for your strength, not for taste. Don't even skip your meals."
It's funny because we are strangers, but he talks to me like I'm his own child. He gives me all this little advice, just checking in and making sure I'm doing okay.
It feels so warm to have someone care like that, especially when I'm away from home. I'm just really, really thankful for him and his kind words. It makes a big difference.<br>
person 2: warden muthu
I want to write down how grateful I am for one of our hostel wardens, Mr. Muthu.
It all started on a random night not too long ago. I was walking to the mess for dinner, and he just started a conversation with me. He asked where I was from, and when I said "Tiruppur," he got kind of excited. He asked where exactly in Tiruppur, and then he asked what my father does.
I told him I don't have a father. The moment I said that, he was so kind. He immediately changed the topic so I wouldn't feel bad or worried. He started telling me that he worked in Tiruppur for 10 years and began sharing his own stories about his life. It really meant a lot to me how he handled that.
Ever since that night, he's different with me than just a normal warden. He always asks me if I've eaten or if I need any help with anything.
It makes me feel really cared for. He doesn't just act like a warden doing his job; he genuinely seems to care about me. I'm very, very grateful for his kindness.<br>
person 3: cr(pranay)
I feel so incredibly lucky and grateful for my friend, Pranay.
When I first joined, he was just my Class Representative (CR), and I didn't really know him that well. But now, after just a few months, he's become one of my closest friends.
It's hard to pick one day or time to talk about, because we're pretty much always together. He genuinely cares about me and always helps me out with studies. We have this amazing system with notes—if I'm absent, he'll sincerely take notes for both of us, and I do the same for him. It's such a relief to know someone has your back like that.
After coming to the hostel, things were tough sometimes, and he was the person I could actually cry to about my personal problems. He just listened and was there for me.
It's only been about three months, but it honestly feels like we've been friends for 10 years. I can't really put into words how thankful I am to have him, not just as our CR, but as my best friend.
