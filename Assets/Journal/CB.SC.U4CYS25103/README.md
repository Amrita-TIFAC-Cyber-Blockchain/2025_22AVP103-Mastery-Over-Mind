# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
To: -  My friends
My friends, some of the moments with my friends in amrita were one of the happiest, funniest and memorable moments of my life. It was chill, chaotic and very risky but fun and messing with each other, helping each other and also being there for someone when they need you the most, never made me alone or lonely in my life and taught me the importance of true friendship. I am a shy and awkward person when it comes to meeting new people and trying to be friends with them but after seeing how easy it was to make friends with the guys in Amrita i don't feel shy or awkward anymore and its honestly been fun. So i am thankful to my friends.

Second the highly qualified and friendly faculties of Amrita who teach really well and are not scary or strict but are chill approachable and very helpful. I had a totally opposite view of them before attending their first class, especially cyber security essentials sir but turns out he's a chill and nice sir who also teaches very well and is very helpful although he could be a bit scary as an invigilator. Its not that everyone is chill ( Some really strict teachers are there sure :) ) but yea most of them are cool. 

Third, the class advisors, although i have not personally went and spoke to them or anything but i know they are ready to support or help us whenever required for the whole class and also make sure we are updated with new rules or anything and sudden twists that could happen ( i mean sudden exam announcement or something ). They are friendly and approachable as well. 

Last but not the least, the lab assistants. One of the labs for us is really confusing even though we have the theory knowledge of it since all the connections and practical stuff gets confusing a lot sometimes but the lab assistants spend their time explaining us how each thing works and how it all connects and how the theory knowledge is the main base for it and due to their crucial help during times like these, we know we are safe for lab evaluation and won't get a zero or just end up standing there like a fool.
