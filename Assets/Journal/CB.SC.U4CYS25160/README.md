That’s when my senior, Revanth, noticed my hesitation and approached me with a warm smile, offering to help. She patiently introduced me to classmates, explained how different departments and labs functioned, and even shared tips on managing assignments, projects, and deadlines effectively. Beyond academics, he gave me advice on how to balance studies with extracurricular activities and how to make the most of college life. his friendly and approachable nature made it easy for me to ask questions without hesitation, no matter how small or silly they seemed. he didn’t just guide me academically but also motivated me to believe in myself, step out of my comfort zone, and try new experiences. Because of her support, I began to feel more confident, welcomed, and prepared to face the challenges of college life..
