# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind

## Journal Record

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to three individuals from my college who have significantly impacted my day-to-day life — Mr. Srinivasan, Mr. Amit Agarwal, and Mr. Boopathy. 
On October 23, 2025, during one of Mr. Srinivasan’s Mathematics classes, I had a very silly doubt that I was almost ashamed to ask. Instead of brushing it aside, he took the time to explain the concept until I got it right. 
His cheerful disposition and motivational style of teaching have completely changed my perspective on the subject. That was the moment when I realized how great a teacher can convert fear into curiosity. 
On August 30, 2025, in Mr. Amit Agarwal’s Principles of Engineering class, I reached late due to a bus delay. Rather than admonishing me or cutting attendance, he simply asked me to sit down and continue learning. 
His calm and understanding demeanor made me feel respected and valued as a student which greatly affected how I perceive discipline and empathy in education. 
Lastly on November 1, 2025, I am particularly thankful to Mr. Boopathy from the canteen staff because that particular day the canteen was fully packed and my friends and I were very hungry; he immediately recognized us and without any hesitation arranged for a table for us. 
His daily friendly greetings along with his acts of kindness remind me that true respect and goodness go beyond all roles and hierarchies.
