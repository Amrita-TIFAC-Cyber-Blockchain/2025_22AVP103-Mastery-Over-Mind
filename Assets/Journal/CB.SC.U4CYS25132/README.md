# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario  1

Date: October 13
Whom: Library Staff

On October 13, I went to the college library for the first time because I needed some reference books. I didn’t know where to find anything, and I felt a bit lost walking through the shelves. Seeing my confusion, the library staff member, Ms. Anitha, came to me with a smile and asked if I needed help.

She patiently showed me where the books were kept and explained how the borrowing system works. She even told me how to check availability and the return dates. Her friendly nature instantly made me feel comfortable.

That small interaction made a big difference. I understood how helpful the library staff are, and from that day on, I started using the library confidently without hesitation.


Scenario 2

Date: November 10
Whom: Hostel Warden – Mr. Aravindan

On November 10, I had a simple but memorable interaction with our hostel warden, Mr. Aravindan. That evening, the power in my room suddenly went off because of a fuse issue. I didn’t know whom to contact, so I quickly went to the warden’s office.

He listened carefully and immediately arranged for an electrician to check the problem. Within a few minutes, the issue was fixed. After that, he also told me whom to approach if something like this happens again.

This experience made me realise how supportive and responsible our warden is. His quick response helped me continue my studies peacefully, and it also made me feel safe staying in the hostel.



Scenario 3
Date: August 8
Whom: Campus Worker 

On August 8, my very first day of college, I arrived on campus early in the morning but had no idea how to get to my hostel. I stood near the entrance with my bags, feeling confused and unsure of which direction to take.

An elderly campus worker, who looked like a grandfather, noticed me standing there. He walked up to me kindly and asked, “Looking for the hostel?” His tone made me feel instantly comfortable.

I told him it was my first day and I didn’t know the way. He smiled warmly and pointed out the route step by step, explaining each turn clearly so I wouldn’t get lost. He even walked a little distance with me to make sure I was on the right path.

His help made a big difference for me on that nervous first day. Instead of feeling lost, I felt supported.

This small but meaningful interaction showed me how caring and helpful campus staff can be, especially for students who are new to the college environment.
