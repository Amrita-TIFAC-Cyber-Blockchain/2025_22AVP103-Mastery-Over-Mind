# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
## Journal Record
1st scenario:i am very thankfull to my friend jashwanth when i first came to this campus he helped him to find out the campus and my classroom .First of all, I am really grateful for the way my friend supports me in every situation. Whether I am having a good day or a bad one, they always find a way to make me feel better. Even when I don’t say anything, they somehow understand that something is wrong and try their best to cheer me up. Not everyone gets a friend like that, and I feel lucky that I do.

One thing I appreciate most is that my friend doesn’t judge me. I can talk freely about anything—small problems, personal issues, silly thoughts, or even my fears. They never make fun of me or make me feel embarrassed. Instead, they listen with patience and try to give me honest advice. For a student like me, who is still learning about life, this kind of friendship feels really safe and comforting.

I am also thankful for the fun moments we share. Sometimes it’s not about big events but the small things we do together—like walking to school, sharing snacks, making jokes, laughing at random things, or just talking about our day. These moments might look simple, but they mean a lot to me. They make my day lighter and less stressful, especially when schoolwork feels too much.

Another thing I truly value is how my friend motivates me. Whenever I feel like giving up or I lose confidence, my friend encourages me to keep going. They remind me of the goals I set and the progress I’ve already made. It’s nice to have someone who believes in you even when you don’t believe in yourself. Their words have helped me many times, especially during exams or when I felt stressed about something.

scenarion 2:mohitreddy is a powerfull and influencial person in the amrita campus he know so many seniors when a senior caught me he helped me to get rid of that situation and he called his brother who is the super senior and they left us.My friend has also taught me many things without even trying. Watching how they handle problems, how they treat people, and how they stay positive even on tough days has inspired me. I’ve learned patience, kindness, and confidence just from seeing how they live their life. These lessons are not written in textbooks, but they are just as important as anything we learn in school.

I am especially grateful for the times when my friend has helped me when I was struggling. There were days when I felt really low or confused, and they stood by me even when I didn’t ask. Sometimes they helped me study. Sometimes they listened to my problems. Sometimes they distracted me with jokes. And sometimes they just stayed silent but stayed with me. All these things matter, even if they seem small.

scenario 3:lokesh my friend is als a help full person and i am very thankfull to him he explained me every topic before the exam and ajay also helped me in this process and i am very thankfull to that person.I also appreciate how my friend remembers small things about me—like my likes, dislikes, favourite snacks, or even the subjects I struggle with. It shows that they care enough to notice. In a world where everyone is busy with their own problems, having someone who pays attention to you is special.

Sometimes I think about how different my life would be without this friend, and honestly, it would feel empty. Many of my happiest memories in school are connected to them. The fun, the laughter, the secrets, the adventures, the class moments—all of these feel special because they were shared with them.
