For Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi Devi) 
     I am extremely grateful for Amma's love and guidance.Even though I may not see her everyday, her compassion and wisdom constantly inspire me to stay grounded, kind and selfless love. Amma's guidance remainds me that education isn't just about gaining knowledge-it's about growing in empathy and inner peace.

For Ramaguru Sir
     Even though our time togather was very brief, through the meditation classes, taught us about being aware, present and kind to ourselves and others. It has brought a sense of grounding and clarity that stays with us beyond the meditation hall.Thank you, sir, for sharing your time, your patience, and your light with us. We carry your lessons forward with gratitude and warmth in our hearts.
