Life often blesses us with people who become our anchors in unfamiliar circumstances. For me, that blessing came in the form of my dearest friends, Sathwika and Deepthi, at Amrita University. When I first joined the university, everything felt new and strange—the atmosphere, the hostel life, and the routine. Having stayed at home all my life, it was my first time being away from my family, and I worried that I might find it difficult to adjust. But soon, these two wonderful souls came into my life and turned my hesitation into comfort, my nervousness into joy.Right from the very beginning, Sathwika and Deepthi welcomed me with their polite behavior and caring nature. Their kindness made the initial days of hostel life smooth and less lonely. Instead of missing home constantly, I found myself laughing and adjusting easily, thanks to their warmth and companionship. They not only helped me adapt to hostel life but also became like family. Their presence reminded me that real friendship is about making each other feel cared for and understood.Living together in a hostel room has been a delightful experience because of the way we support and help each other in everything. Whether it’s handling day-to-day chores or finishing academic assignments, my friends are always ready to lend a hand. We clean our room together regularly, turning what might seem like a boring task into something filled with fun and teamwork. There is a genuine sense of cooperation among us; none of us hesitates to help, and that spirit keeps our bond strong and comforting.One of the funniest yet sweetest parts of our daily life is our morning routine. My alarm goes off first thing in the morning, and instead of me waking up immediately, my friends wake up before me because of it. They never get annoyed; instead, they make sure to wake me up with a smile or a gentle nudge. These small moments add to the affection and laughter that fill our days.Sharing food has also become one of our favorite traditions. Whether it’s a snack from home or something we’ve bought from the cafeteria, we love exchanging bites and trying each other’s favorites. Through these little acts, we’ve learned more about each other’s tastes, families, and cultures. In the evenings, we often go for walks together, enjoying the cool breeze and talking about everything from academic plans to personal dreams. These walks refresh our minds and strengthen our friendship even more.Looking back, I realize how special these friendships are. Sathwika and Deepthi have made my life at Amrita University brighter and more beautiful. They brought joy into my everyday routine and made me feel like I belong. I am deeply grateful to them for their kindness, support, and genuine care. Friendship like this is a blessing that stays in the heart forever, and I will always treasure the times we share together.

Scenario 3
24/08/2025
When I first entered Amrita University, I was filled with curiosity, excitement, and a fair amount of confusion. A new chapter of life was beginning, and like many first-year students, I carried several doubts about academics, hostel life, and the vibrant events our university organizes. Everything seemed unfamiliar—the campus, the routines, and the responsibilities that come with living independently for the first time. During this transition, one person made all the difference: a senior I met during the induction program. Their kindness, guidance, and encouragement left a deep impression on me, and this note is my humble way of expressing gratitude.During the induction period, our seniors interacted with us to help us adjust and understand university life. Among them, one senior stood out for their patience and genuine willingness to help. I had so many questions—about how to balance academics with extracurricular activities, how to participate in the fests that Amrita is well known for, and how to plan my time effectively. Instead of simply giving brief responses, my senior took the effort to explain everything clearly. They shared their own experiences from the initial days, told me about the various opportunities available for students, and assured me that everyone starts the journey with uncertainty, but with time and support, things become easier.One memorable thing was how they spoke about the fests conducted at Amrita University. They described how those events are not only a platform for showcasing talent but also a way to develop teamwork, leadership, and creativity. Their enthusiasm made me look forward to participating. Later, when the fest season arrived, their advice helped me confidently volunteer and engage in activities that I had never tried before. That experience not only gave me joy but helped me understand the importance of community and collaboration—values that Amrita upholds deeply.Beyond events and academics, my senior also gave me valuable guidance on personal growth. They advised me to approach learning with sincerity rather than pressure, to ask questions openly, and to seek balance between study and self-care. Whenever I faced minor challenges, their calm words reminded me that college life is a journey of discovery, not a race. This mindset slowly helped me gain confidence and clarity about my goals.Looking back now, I realize how fortunate I was to meet such a senior at the right time. Their small acts of help had a lasting influence on my outlook toward learning and life on campus. True mentorship is not about giving instructions; it is about inspiring someone to find their own path. My senior did exactly that. I sincerely thank them for being patient, approachable, and genuinely caring. People like them make the Amrita community special. I hope to carry forward that same spirit by helping newcomers just as my senior helped me. Their kindness continues to motivate me, and my gratitude toward them will always remain heartfelt.
