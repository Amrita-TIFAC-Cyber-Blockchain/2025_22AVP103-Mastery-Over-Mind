# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

Scenario 1
Date: During Gokulashtami week
To: 2nd year akkas
  For helping me chant sloka during Gokulashtami without any mistake, i would like to show gratitude towards them for helping me and my friends learn the sloka during the week before the program as only much time was available. I believe they had to work harder than we had done for the sloka to be well chanted in a limited time and was chanted loudly and clearly.


Scenario 2
Date: September
To : My Hackathon teammates and mentor
    With the help of my SIH mentor Ramaguru sir and team members Sreekanth, Arul, Midhun, Sathwika and Rishijith, i was able to participate and qualify for next round. I am very thankful to everyone who helped me and my team in this competition and i would like to express my heartfelt gratitude towards them.


Scenario 3
Date: Past 2 months
To: Aditya, and all my other friends
    Aditya, one of hostel friend gave me medicine and his flask when i had fever, i am to this day very thankful to him. Including him,each and every of my friends have helped me experience "College Life" as mentioned by many people older than me. My hostel mates, classmates and every person who has shown me kindness has been established as a friend to me and i'll help them whenever i can. My roommates has always helped me in many situations where i alone would have gave up. My close friends buys me food, helps me study for exams, and helps me enjoy the life at college. I am very Thankful to each and every one of them.
