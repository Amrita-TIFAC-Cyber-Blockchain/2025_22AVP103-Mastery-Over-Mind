# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

SCENARIO-1
DATE:10.08.2024

I am sincerely thankful to my senior, Prajith, who played a big role in helping me during my initial days in college. When I first joined Amrita University, everything felt new and a bit overwhelming — the campus, the classes, and the pace of college life. At that time, Prajith was the one who guided me and made those early days much easier.

He patiently helped me adjust to the new environment, sharing valuable advice about academics and college life. He treated me like a younger brother — always approachable, understanding, and supportive. Whenever I struggled with a topic or felt unsure about how to study effectively, he would take the time to explain things clearly. He also shared his notes, which were extremely helpful, especially when I was still trying to understand how to prepare for college-level exams.

What I appreciate most is how he gave me confidence to face tougher subjects without fear. Instead of just giving answers, he showed me how to think and approach problems logically. His constant encouragement motivated me to stay focused and consistent.

Beyond academics, his guidance and kind nature made me realize the value of having a good mentor. He showed me that being a senior is not just about experience, but also about helping others grow.

Even now, I look up to Prajith not only as a senior but as a friend and role model who guided me in the right path when I needed it most. I will always be grateful for his support, patience, and genuine care during my early college journey.


SCENARIO-2
DATE: 2MONTHS BEFORE

I am truly grateful to my friend Darshan, who supported me during one of the most stressful times this semester — my mid-term exam preparation, especially for Cyber Security Essentials, one of the toughest subjects we had.

During that week, I felt completely overwhelmed. No matter how many times I read the chapters, the concepts refused to make sense. I was worried, tense, and honestly scared of failing. While most students were busy with their own preparation, Darshan did something I will always remember — he sat with me, guided me, and made sure I understood everything clearly.

On the night before the exam, he stayed with me until 2:00 AM, patiently explaining every single concept, one by one. He never once showed irritation or tiredness. Whether it was encryption types, network security layers, threat classifications, or basic protocols, he broke everything down into simple, understandable explanations.

What touched me the most was his willingness to sacrifice his own study time just to make sure I felt confident. He could have easily focused only on his preparation, but instead, he chose to help me when I truly needed it. That night was a turning point — not just academically, but emotionally. His support gave me confidence, clarity, and peace of mind.

This gratitude journal is not just to thank him for helping me score better, but to appreciate the kindness and sincerity behind his efforts. True friends are those who stand by you when you feel lost — and in that moment, Darshan proved exactly that.

I am genuinely grateful for his friendship, compassion, and patience. He didn’t just help me study; he helped me believe in myself again.r into confidence and stress into strength.

SCENARIO-3
DATE: 6.08.2025

When I first joined Amrita University, everything was new — the place, the people, and the feeling of being away from home. On the day I came with my father for admission, we faced a small but stressful situation. We needed to go outside the campus for some work, but there was no proper transport available at that moment. That’s when a person I had never met before — the cycle seller near the Amrita gate — showed an incredible act of kindness.

Even though he usually never lends his two-wheeler to anyone, he noticed our difficulty and immediately offered to help. Without hesitation, he handed us his bike and said, “Don’t worry, sir, take it and go. You can return it later.” His trust and generosity in that moment left a deep impression on both me and my father.

It wasn’t a big gesture to him, but to us, it meant a lot. It showed how some people, even strangers, can show pure kindness without expecting anything in return. His simple act of helping us during that crucial time made the start of my college journey smooth and memorable.

Even today, whenever I pass by his cycle shop, I remember his goodness and smile with gratitude. He reminded me that humanity still exists in the simplest forms — in trust, kindness, and helping others without expecting anything back.
