## Journal Record
SCENARIO-1
DATE- 2  MONTH AGO
I am sincerely thankful to my senior[PRAJITH], who guided me during my initial days in college. They helped me adjust to the new environment, shared valuable academic and career advice, and treated me like a younger brother. They gave me advice how to study and shared me notes which is really helpful in the initials days. They gave confidence to study the tougher subjects and guided me in the right path.

My Close Friend – [ASHWANTH]
College life wouldn’t be the same without my friend. Whether it’s sharing notes, helping me with assignments, or just making me laugh after a long day, He has been my constant support. We’ve shared both stress and silly jokes, and those small moments make every day special. I’m really grateful for the bond we’ve built — one that reminds me that true friendship is about being there for each other through everything.

Dr Chungath Srinivasan, my Maths professor: 
His patience and thorough explanations in class are greatly appreciated. He makes learning easier and always encourages us to ask questions and clarifies it in understandable way. This week, his teaching over a hard topic was appreciable and understandable.
