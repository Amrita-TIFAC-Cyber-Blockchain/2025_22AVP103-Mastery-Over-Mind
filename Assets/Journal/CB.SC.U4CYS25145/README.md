## Journal Record

SCENARIO-1
DATE:10.08.2024

I am sincerely thankful to my senior, Prajith, who played a big role in helping me during my initial days in college. When I first joined Amrita University, everything felt new and a bit overwhelming — the campus, the classes, and the pace of college life. At that time, Prajith was the one who guided me and made those early days much easier.

He patiently helped me adjust to the new environment, sharing valuable advice about academics and college life. He treated me like a younger brother — always approachable, understanding, and supportive. Whenever I struggled with a topic or felt unsure about how to study effectively, he would take the time to explain things clearly. He also shared his notes, which were extremely helpful, especially when I was still trying to understand how to prepare for college-level exams.

What I appreciate most is how he gave me confidence to face tougher subjects without fear. Instead of just giving answers, he showed me how to think and approach problems logically. His constant encouragement motivated me to stay focused and consistent.

Beyond academics, his guidance and kind nature made me realize the value of having a good mentor. He showed me that being a senior is not just about experience, but also about helping others grow.

Even now, I look up to Prajith not only as a senior but as a friend and role model who guided me in the right path when I needed it most. I will always be grateful for his support, patience, and genuine care during my early college journey.


SCENARIO-2
DATE: 2MONTHS BEFORE

My close friend Ashwanth has played a huge role in making my college life meaningful and manageable. College wouldn’t feel the same without him. Whether it’s sharing notes, helping me with assignments, or making me laugh after a long and stressful day, he has been a constant source of support. We’ve shared both pressure-filled study sessions and hilarious, silly jokes — and those everyday moments have made our bond truly special.

But the main reason I chose to write this gratitude journal about him is because of one particular scenario that deeply touched me.
There was a time early in the semester when I fell behind in a subject due to personal stress and couldn’t keep up with the lessons. I felt lost, embarrassed, and even scared about the upcoming internals. While everyone else was busy with their own studies, it was Ashwanth who immediately noticed something was wrong.

Instead of ignoring it, he sat beside me in the hostel study area, gathered all the notes, and said, “Don’t worry, da. We’ll go through everything together.”
That night, he spent hours explaining every concept patiently, turning the toughest topics into simple ideas I could understand. He didn’t rush, didn’t get irritated, and didn’t give up on me — even when I asked the same doubts repeatedly.

His effort helped me not only pass the test but regain my confidence. More than academic help, it was the care behind his actions that meant the most.

That scenario made me realize how rare it is to find a friend who stands by you not only during fun moments but also during your weakest ones.

I’m truly grateful for Ashwanth — for his kindness, patience, and for being the kind of friend who turns fear into confidence and stress into strength.

SCENARIO-3
DATE: 6.08.2025

When I first joined Amrita University, everything was new — the place, the people, and the feeling of being away from home. On the day I came with my father for admission, we faced a small but stressful situation. We needed to go outside the campus for some work, but there was no proper transport available at that moment. That’s when a person I had never met before — the cycle seller near the Amrita gate — showed an incredible act of kindness.

Even though he usually never lends his two-wheeler to anyone, he noticed our difficulty and immediately offered to help. Without hesitation, he handed us his bike and said, “Don’t worry, sir, take it and go. You can return it later.” His trust and generosity in that moment left a deep impression on both me and my father.

It wasn’t a big gesture to him, but to us, it meant a lot. It showed how some people, even strangers, can show pure kindness without expecting anything in return. His simple act of helping us during that crucial time made the start of my college journey smooth and memorable.

Even today, whenever I pass by his cycle shop, I remember his goodness and smile with gratitude. He reminded me that humanity still exists in the simplest forms — in trust, kindness, and helping others without expecting anything back.
