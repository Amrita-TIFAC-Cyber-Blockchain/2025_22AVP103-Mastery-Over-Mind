# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Date: 11/11/2025 Subject: The three people I met in my college, who I'm grateful to.

**Sahith**: I'm very grateful for Sahith. He is class mate. He is one of the rare people you find who don't take any stress and try to always smile towards hardships in life. He is a very active person in class and he motivates everyone to activately participate in class. He is a very good bargainer, he gave us 1000 rs discount when we went for an outing. 

**Yuva Teja**: Yuva is my classmate and is a very good person. He doesn't give a damn about what others think about him. He focuses only on the beautiful aspects of life like making memories and living in the moment. He is a very good photographer and takes nice aesthetic pictures of the nature.He taught me Bitterness is a repeating cycle of his life which we should face calmly and steadily. 

**Sandilya**: Sandilya is a person who beleives in dharma and righteousness. Even though he sometimes fails to act in a dharmic and righteous manner, he accepts and learns from his mistakes.He is a person of wisdom and doesn't have any evil intentions towards anyone even though they try to hurt him. He taught me to be a kind person and have trust in people which I lacked at start.
