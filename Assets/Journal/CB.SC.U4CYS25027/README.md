# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind

## NAME Journaling 

**Date**: 11/11/2025 
**Subject**: The three people I met in my college, who I'm grateful for.

**Prof. Sourabh**: Sourabh sir is my Cybersecurity essentials professor. Sir is a very kind and generous person. Sir is always ready to answer student doubts- even if it is break time. One day I was having a problem with my HTML website, the website was always crashing and showing an error no matter how much I tried. During the lab session, I was struggling to fix the website and couldn't Keep up with the class. Sir called off the class 20 min earlier and started to answer doubts of all other students, when sir came to solve my doubts it was already lunch time. Sir tried solving my issue, but wasn't able to solve it. He still kept on trying to solve the problem and found out it was an error in the variables. If sir didn't do it at that time I would've not completed the assignment that was later posted. I'm very grateful for Sourabh sir for that incident.

**Yuva Teja**: Yuva Teja is my Friend and classmate. Yuva is a very kind and generous person. Yuva never says anything offending to me or others and is always very helpful to me and others. One day I urgently needed 400 Gpay, but I only had cash. I had asked my roommates and close friends, but no one had it, then, Yuva told me that his friend would Gpay me if I gave cash. Then he called his friend and his friend instantly gave me 400 rs in Gpay. I am grateful for Yuva for that Incident. Another time, I had fever and was sleeping in my room from the moment I came from college and didn't even go for dinner. I was still asleep till when Yuva woke me up at 9pm and had told me to give my hostel attendance and return to sleep. If it hadn't been him that day, the warden would've called me and give me a lecture and punishment to write a letter which would've made the fever worse.

**Sandilya**: Sandilya is my classmate, roommate and a close friend of mine. I met him in the hostel and as we were both from Hyderabad and had a mutual friend we helped each other when necessary. Sandilya is very good at predicting the question paper of examinations held here at Amrita. He had predicted about 70% percent of the questions from each question paper. He is the reason me and our friends performed well in mid-sem. He always gives me money when ever necessary-which I paid him back later. I can't even count the number of times he Google paid money. I am very grateful for having a friend like him.
