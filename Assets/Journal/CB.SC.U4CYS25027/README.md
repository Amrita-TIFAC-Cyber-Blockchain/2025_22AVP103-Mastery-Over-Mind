# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
I just want to write down how thankful i am for a few things.

First, i am just so thankful to God. he has blessed me with so much. he give me strength when i need it and guides me.

And my parents, i am so grateful for them. they are my rock. their love and all the sacrifices they made for me is the only reason i am even here. i am really nothing without them.

I am also so lucky to have my friends. sandilya, jithendra, deepak, yuva, and varshit. they are always there for me, no matter what. college is so much more easier and fun because they are with me.

And finally i feel so blessed to have Amma Amritanandamayi’s guidance. Her love and her blessings is a big inspiration for all of us here and gives us peace.

I'm just so lucky to have all of them in my life.
