I am really thankful for the canteens in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
Though our campus is away from the busy city of Coimbatore, we never feel like we are missing out on anything because canteen food always feels like home.
The variety of the food, the neat surroundings, and friendly staff make every meal special. 
I am grateful to those people who work hard every day, cooking and serving us with care, no matter how hot or busy it gets. 
Sometimes, after long classes, a simple cup of tea or a plate with egg puffs from the canteen tastes like the best thing in this world. 
The food here not only fills our tummies but also gives us comfort and the energy to get through the day. 
I really appreciate how canteens provide tasty, fresh food and take care of so many students with a smile.
It reminds me that gratitude is not just for big things but also for the small everyday moments that make college life happy and complete.
