I feel very thankful for all my teachers here at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. 
You teach us something new with so much patience every day, taking such good care. 
You make difficult concepts so easy and always inspire us to be the best. 
I really admire the way you guide us not only in studies but also in life, teaching us to be kind, humble, and confident. 
Sometimes even a small smile or one or two words from you make a big difference in my whole day. You make us grow not only as good students but also as good people. 
I am indeed grateful to have such hardworking and supportive teachers as yourselves. 
Thank you for being an important part of my journey.
