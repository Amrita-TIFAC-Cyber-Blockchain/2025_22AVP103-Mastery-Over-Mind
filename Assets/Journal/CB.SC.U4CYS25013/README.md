# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
## Journal Record

To whom I feel grateful for

Amma(Mata Amritanandamayi Devi)– My Source of Opportunity

Whenever I walk through the gates of Amrita, I’m reminded that it’s because of Amma, Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, that I’m here. She is the reason thousands like me get a chance to dream big and learn in an environment where compassion comes first. I’m genuinely grateful for her vision and for making a place where students feel both at home and inspired every day. I hope to carry forward her spirit of kindness and give back, just as she’s given me this opportunity.


Mr. Ramaguru Radha Krishnan – The Mindful Guide

My “Mastery Over Mind” classes with Mr. Ramaguru Radha Krishnan are truly special. He doesn’t just teach us about controlling our thoughts or focusing better—he helps us see what we’re capable of when we really understand ourselves. His patient way of explaining things makes difficult ideas seem simple. Whenever I struggle with stress, his advice is always in my mind. I’m sincerely thankful for his steady guidance and encouragement.


Mr. Pranay – Our Dedicated Class Rep

It’s impossible to talk about daily student life without mentioning our class representative, Mr. Pranay. As class rep, he steps up for us in every situation—sorting out schedules, clarifying our doubts, and representing our concerns with the faculty. He handles every issue with patience and keeps us well informed, making sure communication flows smoothly. Pranay always listens, explains things clearly, and builds unity in our group. I appreciate how approachable and responsible he is, making every day a little easier for all of us.
