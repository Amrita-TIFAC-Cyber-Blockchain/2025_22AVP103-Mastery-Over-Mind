# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Date: 18.11.2025
1. The Random Senior Who Became a Lifeline

Today, my mind went back to my very first day of college — a day filled with excitement, nervousness, and the pressure of document verification. I remember the moment I realized I had forgotten to take a printout of an important document. My stomach dropped. My hands literally got cold. I kept thinking, “Great… first day and I’ve already messed up.”

I knew I had to take a printout from the college library, but I had absolutely no idea where it was. Everyone was rushing around, and I felt completely lost. That’s when a random senior — someone who didn’t know me, didn’t have any reason to stop — noticed the confusion on my face.

He could’ve easily ignored me. But instead, he paused, asked me what happened, and then personally showed me the quickest route to the library.
Not just directions — he actually walked a bit with me, making sure I understood the way.

Because of him, I reached the library quickly, got the printout, and submitted everything in time.
If he hadn’t helped, the whole verification process might have gone wrong.

Today, I’m grateful for that stranger who chose kindness over convenience. He probably doesn’t even remember the moment — but I do. And I always will.

2. The Rapido Driver Who Went Beyond His Job

This morning was chaotic in the most cinematic way possible. I was heading to the bus stop like usual, taking a Rapido because time was already tight. Halfway through, just when I started to relax, the bike suddenly started slowing down. Then it stopped.

Fuel empty.

I checked the time — 10 minutes left before the bus would leave. My heart dropped again.
Worse, neither he nor I could cancel the ride midway, and the app wouldn’t let me book another. Traffic was loud, time was slipping, and I felt this helpless frustration building up.

But the driver… he didn’t panic.
He didn’t get annoyed.
He didn’t blame anyone.

Instead, he calmly said, “Don’t worry, sir. I’ll take care of it.”

Right there, on the side of the road, he took out his own phone, opened his driver version of the Rapido app, and booked another ride for me using his account. He didn’t even think twice.
He didn’t ask for extra money.
He didn’t try to negotiate or complain.
He just wanted to help.

Because of him, I reached the bus stop exactly on time — not one minute late.

Today, I’m grateful for that driver who treated me not like a customer, but like a human being who needed help. His kindness stayed in my mind long after I reached college.

3. The Almost-Stranger Classmate Who Saved My Test

During an internal assessment, I had one of those classic college moments — I realized I had forgotten my scientific calculator. That sinking feeling came instantly. Everyone else was already gearing up to start, and there I was, empty-handed, irritated with myself, and stressed about the test.

That’s when a classmate — someone I barely even knew, someone I had spoken to maybe once — noticed the worried look on my face. Without hesitation, they reached into their bag and said, “Hey, I have a spare. You can use this.”

Just like that. No hesitation. No second thoughts.
A small gesture, but it completely changed my day.

Because of that single act of kindness, I was able to write my test peacefully.
It reminded me that help can sometimes come from people you least expect — and that kindness doesn’t need a friendship or familiarity. It just needs a heart.

Today, I’m deeply grateful for that classmate who chose to step in when I needed help the most.
