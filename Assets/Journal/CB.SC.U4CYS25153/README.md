# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Scenario 1 – To Senior

Today, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for the unexpected kindness I received during a stressful time. During the 4-day gap, I lost my hall ticket and was completely tense, not knowing what to do. I searched everywhere but couldn’t find it.At that moment, one senior brother became a blessing for me. He found my hall ticket and responsibly gave it to my hostel reception. When I heard that my hall ticket had been safely returned, I felt so relieved and grateful. His small act of kindness removed a huge burden from my mind.

For My Roommates

Today, I’m grateful for my roommates who make every day on campus fun and memorable.We study together, play together, and even watch movies like a small family.
Their presence makes even stressful days feel lighter and more manageable.With them, every moment — from group studies to late-night fun — becomes special.
I’m thankful to have roommates who turn ordinary days into amazing memories.

Today, I’m grateful for Ramaguru Sir and the powerful message he shared on our first day of orientation.His explanation about overthinking and how it steals our peace made me understand my mind better.He taught us simple ways to stay calm, focus on what truly matters, and let go of unnecessary thoughts.
His words still guide me whenever I feel stressed.
