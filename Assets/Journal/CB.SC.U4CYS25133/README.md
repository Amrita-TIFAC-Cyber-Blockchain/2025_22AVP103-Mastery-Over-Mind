# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1:

Date: 2 weeks after coming to amrita
Situation: High Fever

I am grateful to my friends who helped me get better when I had the fever. Their immediate assistance when I needed their help to go to the doctor and get medicine helped me a lot.

Scenario 2:

Date: Before Mid-Term Physics Exam
Situation: Numerical solving in physics

I'm grateful to my friends Ruchika and Jerush (both from my class) who helped me understand the concepts behind the numericals provided by the professors and doing the solution. Without their help I would have had trouble during the exam to do those concept related questions.


Scenario 3:

Date: Everyday scenario

I am grateful to the cleaning and maintenance staff who ensure that everything, from the classroom boards to the corridors, is clean and well maintained.
