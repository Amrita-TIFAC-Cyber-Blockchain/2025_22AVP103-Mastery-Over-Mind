## Journal Record
Scenario 1: Gratitude to Ramguru Sir
I am really indebted to Ramguru Sir-he is one of the most empathetic and supportive faculty members I have ever come across. The incident happened during our internal Smart India Hackathon (SIH) selections and taught me a valuable lesson on responsibility, forgiveness, and leadership.
Our team was working hard to come up with an innovative idea for the hackathon. Days had been spent brainstorming, refining our proposal, and perfecting everything. On the day of form submission, which was for the internal round, I was the one assigned to fill in the details of our team. Unfortunately, due to the excitement and the hurry, I made a careless mistake while filling out the form by putting incorrect information about the roll numbers and names. The form was important since it would contain official information of all participants.
When I realized what I had done, it was already too late. I felt quite anxious, full of guilt; I thought my mistake would cost our team the chance to participate. Everybody in my team was disappointed, but they didn't blame me; rather, they told me to approach Ramguru Sir and explain what had happened. At first, I was very hesitant because I expected to be scolded or even disqualified. But when I mustered the confidence to meet him, he listened patiently to all that I said , made me realise my mistake and allow my team to participate.

Scenario 2: Gratitude to a M.Tech Senior
It all started when I took a deep interest in cybersecurity but didn’t know where to begin. The domain was so big and confusing; it had an immense number of tools, concepts, and platforms. Around that time, one of our M. Tech seniors noticed our interest and decided to step in, helping us. Rather than keeping his knowledge to himself, he made a dedicated Telegram group for all the students who were interested in cybersecurity.
Within that group, he started sharing valuable resources He even curated structured learning paths for topics like ethical hacking, network analysis, and web application security. What really impressed me was how organized and student-friendly everything was. He made sure every resource was understandable, even for beginners.
What made his efforts truly special was that he didn’t have to do any of it: he wasn’t being paid or assigned by the faculty, he simply wanted to make life easier for others and share knowledge. Seeing someone so selfless help juniors made me realize the power of community learning and mentorship.
Personally, this boosted my motivation to learn cybersecurity seriously and in a disciplined manner. That made me value how one person's initiative positively affects so many others. .
 I learned that the real way in which learning occurs is through the support of each other, not by trying to outdo someone. It also taught me the value of paying it forward — one day I hope to be able to do the same for others as he did with us. I will always be grateful for how he took the time to create a space where young cybersecurity enthusiasts like me could grow and learn together.

Scenario 3: Gratitude for Saurabh Sir
Im thankful to him for teaching complex topics and tools such as Wireshark and Burp Suite in a way that is simple, clear, and engaging.
Before attending his classes, I used to find cybersecurity tools intimidating. I would often hear terms like “packet capture,” “intercepting traffic,”  and assume they were too advanced for me to understand. But when Saurabh Sir began explaining these tools, everything changed. He broke down every topic step by step, ensuring that everyone in class understood the fundamentals before moving to complex parts.
His classes were never just about theory. He gave us hands-on experience, demonstrating how tools like Wireshark capture and analyze packets, and how Burp Suite can be used to test web application security. Every concept was backed with real-world examples — that’s what made his lessons memorable.
What stood out most was his patience. I often asked many questions, some of them very basic, but he never once made me feel hesitant or embarrassed. He encouraged curiosity and created an environment where students could explore freely. His calm approach and detailed explanations built my confidence in handling cybersecurity tools, which once seemed impossible.
Thanks to him, I now understand how important practical knowledge is in cybersecurity. His teaching has not only given me technical skills but also a deeper interest in the subject. The way he connects classroom learning with real-world applications is something I deeply admire.
