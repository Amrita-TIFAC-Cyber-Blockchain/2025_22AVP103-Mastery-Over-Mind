## Journal Record
Scenario 1: Gratitude for My Friends
I am truly grateful for my friends who always help and support me, especially during tough times. College for me sometimes feel overwhelming with studies, deadlines, and pressure but my friends make everything easier. Whenever I struggle to understand something, they patiently explain it and even share their notes.
 Whenever I feel low or anxious, they are always there to cheer me up. A small conversation, a walk, or even a joke from them can instantly lift my mood. Their presence reminds me that I’m never alone in this journey. 

Scenario 2: Gratitude for the Staff and Workers 
I am deeply grateful to all the staff and workers who keep our college campus clean, organized, and running smoothly every day. Whether it’s the cleaning staff, security guards, gardeners, or the kitchen workers, each one contributes to making our daily life comfortable. They wake up early, work hard behind the scenes, and rarely get the appreciation they deserve.
Because of their efforts, we can attend classes, eat meals on time, and enjoy a beautiful, safe environment.

Scenario 3: Gratitude for My Teachers and Staff

I’m sincerely grateful to all my teachers and staff who make learning such a positive experience. Some subjects once seemed impossible for me to understand, but my teachers explain everything so clearly that even difficult topics feel easy and interesting. They are patient, dedicated, and always willing to help whenever I have doubts.
Their encouragement motivates me to keep improving and to never give up on any subject My teachers and staff have not only improved my academic knowledge but also shaped my confidence and attitude towards learning. I feel truly lucky to be guided by such hardworking and inspiring people.
